Contract Verification & Ownership Clarification
1. Purpose of This Contract Verification Page
This page provides a precise, non-promotional, and technically grounded overview of the USI Moonik Token (USI) smart contract.

It exists primarily to satisfy blockchain explorer review standards, particularly those of BscScan, which require:

Clear explanation of contract behavior
Explicit disclosure of ownership scope
Identification of responsible human parties
Confirmation of immutability and lack of hidden control
Nothing on this page constitutes an investment claim, financial promise, security audit, or assurance of value.

All statements are derived exclusively from the publicly verified smart contract source code and observable on-chain behavior.

2. Technical Contract Summary
Blockchain: BNB Smart Chain (BSC)
Token Standard: BEP-20
Contract Status: Fully Verified on BscScan
Verification Date: December 04, 2025
Upgradeable / Proxy Pattern: Not used
Mint Function: Not implemented
Burn Function: Not implemented
Transaction Fees / Taxes: 0%
Blacklist / Pause Mechanism: Not present
Balance or Supply Modification: Not possible
The smart contract was deployed as a fixed, non-upgradable BEP-20 token.

All logic governing transfers, balances, and total supply is permanently embedded in the deployed bytecode and cannot be altered, extended, or replaced.

3. Supply Immutability & Transfer Neutrality
The contract contains no minting functionality, meaning no additional tokens can ever be created after deployment.

Similarly, no burn or destruction mechanism exists, which means the total supply cannot be reduced.

As a result, the total supply is strictly fixed and verifiable on-chain at all times using standard blockchain explorer tools.

The contract also excludes any logic that could influence transfer behavior, such as fees, taxes, penalties, or address-specific rules.

Every transfer follows the standard BEP-20 balance model without exception.

4. Ownership Structure & Authority Limitations
The smart contract includes a minimal ownership reference solely for compatibility, traceability, and accountability purposes.

This ownership reference does not grant any form of financial, administrative, or behavioral control over the token.

Specifically, the contract owner cannot:

Mint or burn tokens
Increase or decrease total supply
Modify user balances
Restrict, freeze, or block addresses
Introduce fees, taxes, or transfer rules
Pause or disable the contract
From an operational standpoint, the contract behaves equivalently to a fully ownership-renounced token.

5. Deployer, Owner & Human Responsibility Clarification
The contract was deployed by a specific blockchain address, which is publicly visible on BscScan.

Control of the deployer wallet has been cryptographically proven via an on-chain message signature, which links the deployer address to the publicly disclosed project owner.

This proof exists to satisfy transparency requirements and to establish clear human accountability, not to imply privileged control.

The deployer / owner role is limited strictly to:

Initial contract deployment
Source code verification submission
Public documentation and clarification
No ongoing authority, economic privilege, or unilateral power exists after deployment.

Detailed cryptographic proof of deployer ownership is provided on the Cryptographic Ownership Verification page.

6. Immutability, Transparency & Independent Verification
The contract is not upgradeable and does not rely on external logic, delegate calls, or proxy patterns.

All execution paths are fully visible within the verified source code and can be independently reviewed by any developer or third party.

This guarantees that the contract will continue to behave exactly as it does today for its entire lifetime on the blockchain.

Verified Contract Address:
0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef

Reviewers and users are explicitly encouraged to rely on direct on-chain data and the verified source code, rather than off-chain summaries or claims.
