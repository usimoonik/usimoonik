## 3. Smart Contract Design, Limitations & Immutability

The smart contract was deliberately designed to remove any form of  
discretionary or centralized control after deployment.

- No minting function – supply cannot be increased  
- No burn function – balances cannot be arbitrarily destroyed  
- No transaction taxes, fees, or redistribution logic  
- No blacklist, whitelist, freeze, or pause mechanisms  
- No upgradeability or proxy architecture  
- No administrative privileges after deployment  
- Contract ownership permanently renounced  

These characteristics ensure that the contract behaves exactly as  
verified on BscScan and cannot be altered, influenced, or abused  
by the project creator or any third party.
