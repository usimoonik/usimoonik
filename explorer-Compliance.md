Explorer Compliance & Maximum Transparency Statement
USI Moonik Token (USI) • BEP-20 • BNB Smart Chain • Educational & Transparency Project

1. Purpose, Scope & Reason for This Detailed Disclosure Page
This dedicated page is created and published specifically to provide clear, verifiable, non-ambiguous, and extremely detailed information about the USI Moonik Token project for blockchain explorers (especially BscScan), manual reviewers, auditors, and the public.

It is intentionally written in extended, repetitive, and explicit form to:

Eliminate any possible misinterpretation or automated rejection during BscScan review
Fully satisfy requirements for clear project/token identity and accessibility of information
Provide transparent disclosure of founder, team, and responsibility with public professional profiles
Prevent any perception of misrepresentation, copied content, or affiliation with third parties
This document explicitly clarifies what the project is, what it is not, who is responsible, and that all information is original and truthful.

2. Token Identification & Full On-Chain Verifiability – Clear & Accessible
USI Moonik Token (symbol: USI) is a standard BEP-20 token deployed on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). All parameters, behavior, supply, and transactions are permanently recorded on the public blockchain and can be independently verified by anyone without trusting any off-chain party.

Token Name: USI Moonik Token
Symbol: USI
Standard: BEP-20 (fully compliant with official specification)
Network: BNB Smart Chain (BSC)
Total Supply: Exactly 999,000,000,000 USI (999 billion) – permanently fixed at deployment, no minting possible
Decimals: 18
Smart Contract Address: 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef
Verification Status: Source code fully verified on BscScan since December 04, 2025 (bytecode matches published code)
Anyone can check:

Total supply (totalSupply() function)
All transfers and balances
Absence of mint/burn/tax functions
Immutability of the code

This level of on-chain transparency ensures maximum accessibility of project and token information — directly addressing any concern about "no clear information available".

3. Smart Contract Design, Hard-Coded Limitations & Complete Immutability
The smart contract was intentionally written to be minimal, readable, and completely immutable — removing every possible source of future control, inflation, or risk.

No minting function → supply cannot be increased (fixed at 999 billion forever)
No burn function → no arbitrary destruction of tokens
No transaction taxes, fees, reflections, or redistribution logic
No blacklist, whitelist, freeze, pause, or address restriction mechanisms
No upgradeable proxy, UUPS, or replaceable logic → contract cannot be changed
No owner/admin functions to modify balances or interfere with transfers
No hidden or obfuscated code → fully verifiable and auditable
The contract implements only the standard BEP-20 functions (transfer, approve, allowance, balanceOf, totalSupply) — nothing more. This design choice eliminates all possible economic manipulation or central control, making it a pure educational demonstration.

Full source code is available on BscScan Code Tab for independent review.

4. Explicit Project Purpose – Strictly Educational, Non-Financial & Non-Commercial
USI Moonik Token is a strictly educational blockchain demonstration project created to showcase how a minimal, immutable BEP-20 token operates on BNB Smart Chain.

It serves as a public learning reference for:

Understanding smart contract deployment and verification
Demonstrating fixed supply and immutability in practice
Exploring BEP-20 standard behavior on-chain
Supporting BscScan/explorer review and compliance processes
The project is NOT:

A financial product, security, investment opportunity, or profit-generating asset
Connected to any fundraising, ICO/IDO, presale, or token sale
Promising or implying any returns, appreciation, or economic value
A commercial platform, utility token, or service provider
Involved in staking, yield, rewards, airdrops, or incentive programs
No governance, voting, DAO, or user rights/entitlements
No investment, commercial, or profit-oriented intent exists. This is repeated to eliminate any possible confusion.
