# Explorer Compliance & Maximum Transparency Statement

**USI Moonik Token (USI) • BEP-20 • BNB Smart Chain • Educational & Transparency Project**

## 1. Purpose, Scope & Reason for This Detailed Disclosure Page

This dedicated page is created and published **specifically** to provide **clear, verifiable, non-ambiguous, and extremely detailed** information about the USI Moonik Token project for blockchain explorers (especially BscScan), manual reviewers, auditors, and the public.

It is intentionally written in **extended, repetitive, and explicit form** to:

- Eliminate any possible misinterpretation or automated rejection during BscScan review
- Fully satisfy requirements for clear project/token identity and accessibility of information
- Provide transparent disclosure of founder, team, and responsibility with public professional profiles
- Prevent any perception of misrepresentation, copied content, or affiliation with third parties

This document explicitly clarifies **what the project is**, **what it is not**, **who is responsible**, and **that all information is original and truthful**.

## 2. Token Identification & Full On-Chain Verifiability – Clear & Accessible

USI Moonik Token (symbol: USI) is a **standard BEP-20 token** deployed on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). All parameters, behavior, supply, and transactions are **permanently recorded on the public blockchain** and can be **independently verified by anyone** without trusting any off-chain party.

- **Token Name:** USI Moonik Token
- **Symbol:** USI
- **Standard:** BEP-20 (fully compliant with official specification)
- **Network:** BNB Smart Chain (BSC)
- **Total Supply:** Exactly 999,000,000,000 USI (999 billion) – permanently fixed at deployment, no minting possible
- **Decimals:** 18
- **Smart Contract Address:** 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef
- **Verification Status:** Source code fully verified on BscScan since December 04, 2025 (bytecode matches published code)

Anyone can check:

- Total supply (totalSupply() function)
- All transfers and balances
- Absence of mint/burn/tax functions
- Immutability of the code

This level of on-chain transparency ensures **maximum accessibility** of project and token information — directly addressing any concern about "no clear information available".

## 3. Smart Contract Design, Hard-Coded Limitations & Complete Immutability

The smart contract was intentionally written to be **minimal, readable, and completely immutable** — removing every possible source of future control, inflation, or risk.

- No minting function → supply cannot be increased (fixed at 999 billion forever)
- No burn function → no arbitrary destruction of tokens
- No transaction taxes, fees, reflections, or redistribution logic
- No blacklist, whitelist, freeze, pause, or address restriction mechanisms
- No upgradeable proxy, UUPS, or replaceable logic → contract cannot be changed
- No administrative functions to modify balances, supply, or behavior
- Ownership renounced in practice → no meaningful privileges remain

These hard-coded restrictions are **enforced by the deployed bytecode** — not by promises or policies. The contract will behave **exactly the same way forever**, exactly as verified on BscScan.

## 4. Project Purpose & Strong Non-Financial / Educational Nature

USI Moonik Token exists **exclusively** as an **educational, transparency-focused blockchain reference project**. Its only purposes are:

- To demonstrate a clean, immutable, standard BEP-20 token deployment
- To serve as a public example of explorer-ready transparency and verification
- To support learning about smart contract immutability, fixed supply, and on-chain accountability

The project is **strictly non-financial**:

- No ICO, IEO, IDO, presale, token sale, or fundraising of any kind
- No profit expectations, price speculation, or financial returns promised/implied
- No staking, yield, rewards, airdrops, or incentive programs
- No governance, voting, DAO, or user rights/entitlements

**No** investment, commercial, or profit-oriented intent exists. This is repeated to eliminate any possible confusion.
