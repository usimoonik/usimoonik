# About USI Moonik Token (USI)

## Project Overview

USI Moonik Token (symbol: USI) is a standard BEP-20 token deployed on the  
BNB Smart Chain. The project was created with a transparency-first philosophy  
and serves as an educational and technical demonstration of how a simple,  
immutable, and verifiable token can operate on a public blockchain.

This project does not function as a financial product.  
It does not promote investment activity or speculation.  
Its purpose is limited to learning, testing, and public on-chain verification.

All token behavior, ownership, and supply information are permanently  
recorded on-chain and independently verifiable through blockchain explorers  
such as BscScan.

## Token Supply & Immutability

The total supply of USI is permanently fixed at:

**999,000,000,000 tokens (999 billion)**

This entire supply was minted one time only at the moment of smart contract  
deployment and assigned to the official owner address.

From a technical and mathematical perspective, the supply is capped forever.

- No mint function exists  
- No inflation mechanism exists  
- No supply expansion is possible  

Under no current or future condition can additional tokens be created.

## Smart Contract Architecture & Verification

The USI Moonik smart contract was intentionally engineered to remain minimal,  
predictable, and easy to audit. Complex or speculative features commonly found  
in financial tokens were deliberately excluded.

The contract **DOES NOT** include:

- Minting or burning  
- Transaction taxes or fees  
- Reflections or rewards  
- Blacklist or whitelist systems  
- Pause or freeze functions  
- Administrative balance control  
- Upgradeable proxy logic  

All transfers follow standard BEP-20 behavior with no hidden side effects.

The complete source code is fully verified on BscScan,  
and the deployed bytecode exactly matches the published code,  
allowing independent review without trust assumptions.

## Ownership, Control & Administrative Policy
