Official Transparency & Identification Statement
USI Moonik Token (USI) – Public Clarification for BscScan Review

Introduction & Purpose
This page serves as an official clarification document specifically created for blockchain explorers like BscScan, as well as for any member of the public interested in verifying the identity, ownership, and technical details of the USI Moonik Token (USI). We have expanded this section to provide more context and ensure full transparency. The USI Moonik Token is a simple, educational smart contract demonstration built on the BNB Smart Chain. It was created to showcase basic token functionality without any financial or speculative elements. This document explains everything in simple, straightforward language, breaking down each aspect step by step so that anyone can understand and verify the information independently.

The sole purpose of this document is to promote transparency. It is not meant to promote the token, provide financial advice, or encourage any form of investment. We emphasize that this is purely informational and educational. No part of this page discusses prices, profits, trading strategies, or potential returns, as the token is not designed for financial purposes.

Every single statement here is based on factual, verifiable evidence. You can check this through:

On-chain contract data directly from the blockchain explorer like BscScan.
The verified smart contract source code, which is publicly available and has been audited for accuracy.
Official project resources, including our website and social channels, all linked below.
Public contact channels where you can reach out for further verification if needed.
To address any concerns about clarity, we have expanded all sections with detailed explanations, avoiding technical jargon where possible, and providing step-by-step breakdowns. No claims are made about financial performance, and all information is presented honestly without any distortion of facts from public entities or other projects.

1. Token Identification & Basic Metadata
In this section, we provide a complete and clear overview of the token's basic details. This information uniquely identifies the USI Moonik Token and allows anyone to verify it directly on the blockchain. We have expanded this to include explanations of each term, why it's important, and how to check it yourself. For example, the token follows the BEP-20 standard, which is the standard for tokens on the BNB Smart Chain, ensuring compatibility with wallets and exchanges. This compliance means the token behaves predictably and securely, just like other BEP-20 tokens.

Token Name: USI Moonik Token – This is the full name of the token, chosen to reflect its educational purpose. It does not imitate or distort any other project or public entity.
Symbol: USI – A simple three-letter ticker for easy reference.
Token Standard: BEP-20 (ERC-20 compatible) – This means it fully complies with BEP-20 specifications, including functions for transfers, balances, and approvals. You can verify this by reviewing the contract code on BscScan.
Network: BNB Smart Chain (BSC) – The blockchain where the token lives, known for low fees and speed.
Decimals: 18 – This defines the smallest unit of the token (like cents in a dollar), standard for most tokens.
Total Supply: 999,000,000,000 (fixed and immutable) – That's 999 billion tokens, minted all at once during deployment. No more can ever be added, which ensures scarcity and predictability.
Contract Address: 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef – Click this link to view it on BscScan.
Source Code: Verified on BscScan on 2025-12-04 – The code is open for anyone to read and confirm it matches the deployed contract.
To explain further: The total supply was created in a single transaction during the contract's deployment. This is verifiable on-chain. There is no code allowing for additional minting, which means the supply is capped forever. This design choice was made to keep things simple and transparent, avoiding any mechanisms that could lead to inflation or unexpected changes.

We confirm there is no hidden minting logic, no way to increase supply, and no inflation mechanisms. Anyone can audit the code to see this for themselves.

2. Smart Contract Technical Characteristics
The smart contract for USI Moonik Token was designed with simplicity and transparency in mind. We avoided complex features to make it easy for anyone to understand and verify. In this expanded section, we'll break down each characteristic, explain what it means, and why it's included (or excluded). The contract is a basic BEP-20 implementation, fully compliant with the standard, meaning it supports standard functions without extras that could introduce risks.

To protect users and ensure everything works as expected, the contract does not include any of the following features. We'll explain each one:

No mint function: This means no new tokens can be created after deployment, preventing supply inflation.
No burn function: Tokens cannot be destroyed, so the total supply remains constant.
No transfer tax or fee: Every transfer is free of extra charges, making it straightforward.
No reflections or rewards: No automatic distributions to holders, keeping it non-financial.
No staking logic: No built-in way to lock tokens for rewards, as this is not a financial product.
No blacklist or whitelist: Everyone can interact equally; no exclusions.
No pause or freeze: The contract can't be stopped, ensuring it's always active.
No forced transfers: No one can move your tokens without your approval.
No hidden or obfuscated code: Everything is clear and verified on BscScan.
No proxy or upgrade system: The contract is immutable; no changes possible after deployment.
Because of these design choices, no one – including the owner – can manipulate token balances or alter the contract. This makes the token extremely safe and predictable for educational purposes. The contract's minimalism reduces the risk of bugs or exploits, and since it's immutable, what you see today is what it will always be.

3. Non-Financial Nature & Use Case
To make this absolutely clear, USI Moonik Token is not intended as a financial instrument. We've expanded this section to provide a detailed explanation of what this means and why it's important. The token does not promise or imply any financial benefits, and all project communications avoid any speculative language.

Specifically, USI Moonik Token does NOT represent or function as:

Investment: It's not something to buy expecting profit.
Equity: No ownership in a company.
Shares: No stock-like features.
Dividends: No payouts to holders.
Profit participation: No sharing in any revenues.
Revenue rights: No claims on earnings.
Ownership of any company: Purely a technical demo.
The project has never and will never engage in:

ICO / IEO / IDO: No initial offerings or sales.
Token sales or presales: No selling of tokens for funds.
Fundraising rounds: No venture capital or investments sought.
Staking or yield programs: No locking tokens for returns.
Reward campaigns: No giveaways implying value.
Any capital raising activity: Strictly non-financial.
We do not communicate any financial expectations or promote speculation. The token's purpose is educational: to demonstrate how a simple BEP-20 token works on the blockchain, serving as a learning tool for developers and enthusiasts.
