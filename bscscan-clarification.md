Official Token Information & Transparency Statement
USI Moonik Token (USI) – BNB Smart Chain

Introduction & Purpose
This page is provided specifically for blockchain explorer verification, including BscScan, and for public transparency. It contains complete, factual, and expanded information about the identity, ownership, technical structure, and non-financial nature of the project. We have detailed each section with simple explanations to ensure clarity and address any concerns about the token or project. The USI Moonik Token is a straightforward educational tool on the BNB Smart Chain, designed to show how basic blockchain tokens work without any financial aspects.

This document is purely informational and educational. It does NOT contain any promotional, investment, or financial content. No discussions about prices, profits, or trading are included, as the focus is solely on transparency and verification.

1. Project Identification & On-Chain Metadata
USI Moonik Token (USI) is a standard BEP-20 token deployed on the BNB Smart Chain. All token parameters are permanently recorded on-chain and can be independently verified through BscScan or any compatible explorer. To make this clear, we've expanded the details below with explanations of each element, why it's important, and how to verify it. For instance, BEP-20 is the token standard on BSC, ensuring it works seamlessly with wallets and other tools.

The purpose of publishing these details is to eliminate ambiguity and provide clear identification for reviewers and users. Everything is verifiable on-chain, with no distortions from other projects or public entities.

Token Name: USI Moonik Token – A unique name for identification, not imitating any other project.
Symbol: USI – Short ticker symbol for easy reference.
Standard: BEP-20 – Fully compliant with BEP-20 specifications, including transfer and balance functions.
Network: BNB Smart Chain – The blockchain platform, chosen for its efficiency.
Decimals: 18 – Standard precision for token units.
Total Supply: 999,000,000,000 (fixed and immutable) – 999 billion tokens, all minted at once.
Contract Address: 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef – Direct link to BscScan for verification.
Source Code Status: Fully Verified on BscScan on 2025-12-04 – Code is public and matches the deployed contract.
Initial Mint: One-time mint at deployment only – No further creation possible.
No additional tokens can ever be created. The supply cannot be increased, modified, or reissued. This is enforced by the contract code, which anyone can review.

2. Project Purpose (Clear, Neutral & Non-Financial)
USI Moonik Token exists solely as an educational and transparency-focused blockchain reference project. We've expanded this to explain in simple terms: It's like a sample code for learning about tokens, not for making money.

Its objective is to demonstrate how a simple, fixed-supply, fully verifiable BEP-20 token operates on-chain. This helps developers and enthusiasts understand blockchain basics without complexity.

The token is used for:

Technical learning – Studying smart contract code and behavior.
Smart contract demonstration – Showing how tokens are minted and transferred.
Testing and experimentation – Safe environment for blockchain trials.
Public verification of blockchain behavior – Allowing anyone to check on-chain data.
The project does NOT pursue commercial, financial, or speculative activities. All focus is on education and transparency, with no distortions or misrepresentations.

3. Explicit Non-Financial Declaration
To avoid misunderstanding, the project explicitly confirms that it is NOT any kind of financial tool. We've detailed this further to emphasize each point.

An investment product: No expectation of returns.
A security or share: No ownership rights.
A fundraising vehicle: No money raised.
A profit-generating instrument: No earnings mechanisms.
A revenue-sharing mechanism: No distributions.
The project has NEVER conducted and will NEVER conduct:

ICO / IEO / IDO: No offerings.
Private or public token sales: No sales events.
Presales or fundraising rounds: No capital seeking.
Airdrops with financial incentives: No giveaways implying value.
Staking, yield, or reward programs: No locking for benefits.
No promises of profit, appreciation, or trading value are made. The project does not promote speculation or financial use. All communications avoid any implication of economic benefits.

4. Contract Restrictions & Safeguards
The smart contract is designed with maximum simplicity and restrictions to ensure transparency and security. Expanded explanations below detail each feature's absence and why it's important.

No mint function: Prevents new token creation.
No burn function: Keeps supply constant.
No transfer fees: No deductions on transactions.
No reflections/rewards: No automatic distributions.
No staking: No locking mechanisms.
No blacklist: Equal access for all.
No pause function: Always operational.
No forced transfers: User control only.
No hidden code: Fully verified.
No proxy/upgrade system: Immutable code.
Because of these restrictions, neither the owner nor any third party can alter user balances or interfere with transfers. This ensures security and fairness.

All behavior is permanently determined by the deployed code, verifiable on BscScan.
