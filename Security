### Supply Transparency Notice
The total fixed supply of 999,000,000,000 USI remains fully in the original deployment wallet used to create and verify the immutable smart contract on BNB Smart Chain (verified on BscScan as of 2025-12-04).

This status reflects the project's initial deployment phase and does not represent a sale, distribution event, presale, airdrop, or investment activity of any kind.

No automated distribution, vesting mechanism, third-party custodian, marketing allocation, or team reserve is involved. The contract contains no minting, burning, taxes, or administrative functions.

The project is strictly educational and transparency-focused. Any on-chain transfers, if they occur in the future, will be publicly visible on BscScan and documented solely for verifiable transparency – with no financial or promotional intent.

This clarification is provided solely to ensure maximum transparency and to prevent ambiguity during blockchain explorer review, including BscScan compliance standards.
