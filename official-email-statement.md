# Official Communication & Email Disclosure

**USI Moonik Token (USI) • Explorer Verification Reference**

## 1. Purpose of This Page

This page exists to clearly disclose and define the single official email communication channel associated with the USI Moonik project. We have expanded this document with detailed explanations in simple language to ensure complete clarity for reviewers, especially blockchain explorers like BscScan.

The primary goals of this page are:

- Blockchain explorer verification correspondence (e.g., BscScan reviews and clarifications)
- Identity and ownership confirmation of the project and its responsible persons
- Documentation clarification or correction when requested by public entities
- Anti-impersonation protection and authenticity validation for the public

By publishing this information openly, we help prevent confusion, impersonation attempts, and any misunderstanding about who controls official project communication. This page is not promotional and contains no financial content.
