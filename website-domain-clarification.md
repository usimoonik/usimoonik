Official Website & Domain Clarification
1. Purpose of This Page
This page is published to formally and explicitly identify the single official website domain associated with the USI Moonik Token (USI) project.

It exists primarily to satisfy blockchain explorer review requirements, particularly those of BscScan, which require clarity regarding:

Official project web presence
Domain authenticity
Responsibility boundaries
Protection against impersonation or misleading sources
This page is informational only and does not serve any promotional, financial, or transactional function.

2. Official Website Domain Declaration
The following domain is the only official website representing the USI Moonik Token (USI) project:

Official Website:
https://usimoonik.com

This domain is used exclusively to publish public-facing informational content, technical explanations, documentation, and transparency disclosures.

No other domain should be interpreted as an official or authoritative source for the USI Moonik project.

3. Scope & Functional Limitations of the Website
The official website operates strictly as a static informational platform.

The website does not:

Host token sales or fundraising mechanisms
Provide investment services or advice
Offer wallet connection or transaction execution
Request private keys or recovery phrases
Collect user data or behavioral analytics
All blockchain interactions related to USI occur exclusively on the BNB Smart Chain and are not mediated, controlled, or monitored by the website.

4. Relationship Between Website, Contract & Ownership
The official website does not control, modify, or influence the USI smart contract in any technical or financial manner.

The website serves only as a human-readable reference layer that explains what is already verifiable on-chain.

Ownership of the website domain does not imply:

Control over token supply
Authority over user balances
Ability to alter contract behavior
Special financial privileges
The relationship between the website and the smart contract is purely descriptive, not operational.

5. Deployer, Maintainer & Accountability Clarification
The website is maintained by the same publicly disclosed individuals responsible for technical deployment and documentation of the project.

This alignment exists solely to ensure:

Accuracy of published information
Clear human accountability
Consistency with on-chain data
Control of the smart contract deployer address has been cryptographically proven via an on-chain signature, which links the deployer wallet to the disclosed project owner.

This proof is published separately on the Cryptographic Ownership Verification page and exists to satisfy transparency requirements only.

6. Third-Party Pages, Mirrors & Repository Sites
Any other domains, mirrors, or repository-hosted pages associated with this project are used strictly for:

Development
Version control
Technical documentation
Such pages do not replace, override, or supersede the official website.

Users and reviewers should not rely on third-party mirrors or unofficial pages for authoritative project information.
