# Official Website & Domain Clarification

## 1. Purpose of This Page

This page is published to formally and explicitly identify the single official website domain associated with the USI Moonik Token (USI) project. We have expanded this document with clear explanations to ensure full transparency about the token and project, addressing BscScan's requirements for clear information, team disclosure, and non-misrepresentation.

The USI Moonik Token is a standard BEP-20 token on the BNB Smart Chain, fully compliant with BEP-20 specifications (e.g., transfer, balance, approval functions). It exists solely for educational purposes, with no financial features. This page clarifies:

- Official project web presence – The only authorized domain.
- Domain authenticity – Owned and controlled by the founder.
- Responsibility boundaries – Non-financial scope only.
- Protection against impersonation or misleading sources – Warnings on unauthorized sites.

This page is informational only and does not serve any promotional, financial, or transactional function. No investment claims or misrepresentations of public entities are made.

## 2. Official Website Domain Declaration

The following domain is the only official website representing the USI Moonik Token (USI) project:

https://usimoonik.com

This domain is used exclusively to publish public-facing informational content, technical explanations, documentation, and transparency disclosures related to the token's BEP-20 structure and educational purpose. It hosts no interactive features or financial tools.

No other domain, subdomain, or website should be interpreted as an official or authoritative source for the USI Moonik project. This prevents confusion and aligns with BscScan's transparency standards.

## 3. Scope & Functional Limitations of the Website

The official website operates strictly as a static informational platform, designed for readability and verification without any dynamic or financial elements.

The website does not:

- Host token sales or fundraising mechanisms – No ICOs or presales.
- Provide investment services or advice – Educational only.
- Offer wallet connection or transaction execution – No on-site interactions.
- Request private keys or recovery phrases – No user data collection.
- Collect user data or behavioral analytics – Privacy-focused.

All content is publicly available, verifiable against on-chain data, and focused on educational transparency. No commercial, promotional, or financial content is present.

## 4. Domain Authenticity & Ownership Proof

The domain usimoonik.com is registered and owned directly by the project founder, with no third-party involvement. Registration details can be verified through public WHOIS queries.

To further prove authenticity and control, we provide on-chain cryptographic verification of the founder's ownership over the deployer wallet. This links the domain ownership to the project's on-chain identity without ambiguity.

**Cryptographic Verification Details:**  
- Deployer Address: 0x22f646f48aa8bf5c7d5dc5bb5f2d8da90641c449  
- Signed Message: "I am the owner and original deployer of the USI Moonik Token (USI), deployed on BNB Smart Chain under contract address 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef. This cryptographic message is signed to publicly verify my ownership, responsibility, and accountability for this project on usimoonik.com for blockchain explorer transparency review purposes as of January 2026."  
- Signature: 0xba60b469d307a0574c036389416348b5a6345e32bac19c26287466c37b5038763249cad6b5cf66e48ac86afa218477cd16ce054756ff1966eaa610ad5acb49911c  

Verify this signature on BscScan or any Ethereum-compatible tool to confirm the founder controls the deployer wallet.

## 5. Project Responsibility & Accountability

The website and domain are maintained solely by the identified founder, who is also the contract deployer. This ensures unified accountability.

**Founder & Domain Owner:**  
usi moonik – Responsible for deployment, maintenance, and transparency.  

Accountability includes:  

- Ensuring all content is factual and verifiable.  
- Maintaining BEP-20 compliance statements.  
- Responding to BscScan verification requests.  
- Preventing any financial or misleading content.  

The founder has no on-chain control post-deployment, as the contract is immutable.

## 6. Alternative & Development Domains

Any other domains, mirrors, or repository-hosted pages associated with this project are used strictly for:

- Development – Testing and code staging.
- Version control – GitHub repos for source code.
- Technical documentation – Supplementary references.

Such pages do not replace, override, or supersede the official website. They are not official and should not be relied upon for authoritative information.

Users and reviewers should not rely on third-party mirrors or unofficial pages for project details, to avoid any potential misrepresentation.
