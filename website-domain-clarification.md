Official Website & Domain Clarification
1. Purpose of This Page
This page is published to formally and explicitly identify the single official website domain associated with the USI Moonik Token (USI) project. We have expanded this document with clear explanations to ensure full transparency about the token and project, addressing BscScan's requirements for clear information, team disclosure, and non-misrepresentation.

The USI Moonik Token is a standard BEP-20 token on the BNB Smart Chain, fully compliant with BEP-20 specifications (e.g., transfer, balance, approval functions). It exists solely for educational purposes, with no financial features. This page clarifies:

Official project web presence – The only authorized domain.
Domain authenticity – Owned and controlled by the founder.
Responsibility boundaries – Non-financial scope only.
Protection against impersonation or misleading sources – Warnings on unauthorized sites.
This page is informational only and does not serve any promotional, financial, or transactional function. No investment claims or misrepresentations of public entities are made.

2. Official Website Domain Declaration
The following domain is the only official website representing the USI Moonik Token (USI) project:

https://usimoonik.com

This domain is used exclusively to publish public-facing informational content, technical explanations, documentation, and transparency disclosures related to the token's BEP-20 structure and educational purpose. It hosts no interactive features or financial tools.

No other domain, subdomain, or website should be interpreted as an official or authoritative source for the USI Moonik project. This prevents confusion and aligns with BscScan's transparency standards.

3. Scope & Functional Limitations of the Website
The official website operates strictly as a static informational platform, designed for readability and verification without any dynamic or financial elements.

The website does not:

Host token sales or fundraising mechanisms – No ICOs or presales.
Provide investment services or advice – Educational only.
Offer wallet connection or transaction execution – No on-site interactions.
Request private keys or recovery phrases – No user data collection.
Collect user data or behavioral analytics – Privacy-focused.
Include any financial promotion or speculation – Non-financial content.
All blockchain interactions related to USI occur exclusively on the BNB Smart Chain and are not mediated, controlled, or monitored by the website. This limitation ensures the site remains a reference tool only.

4. Relationship Between Website, Contract & Ownership
The official website does not control, modify, or influence the USI smart contract in any technical or financial manner. The contract is fully immutable and BEP-20 compliant, with details verifiable on BscScan.

The website serves only as a human-readable reference layer that explains what is already verifiable on-chain, such as the fixed supply and lack of mint/burn functions.

Ownership of the website domain does not imply:

Control over token supply – Fixed at deployment.
Authority over user balances – No admin controls.
Ability to alter contract behavior – Immutable code.
Special financial privileges – Non-financial project.
The relationship between the website and the smart contract is purely descriptive, not operational or controlling, ensuring no misrepresentations.

5. Deployer, Maintainer & Accountability Clarification
The website domain is owned, deployed, and maintained directly by the project founder, who is also the smart contract deployer. This ensures unified accountability.

Founder & Domain Owner:
usi moonik – Responsible for deployment, maintenance, and transparency.

Accountability includes:

Ensuring all content is factual and verifiable.
Maintaining BEP-20 compliance statements.
Responding to BscScan verification requests.
Preventing any financial or misleading content.
The founder has no on-chain control post-deployment, as the contract is immutable.

6. Alternative & Development Domains
Any other domains, mirrors, or repository-hosted pages associated with this project are used strictly for:

Development – Testing and code staging.
Version control – GitHub repos for source code.
Technical documentation – Supplementary references.
Such pages do not replace, override, or supersede the official website. They are not official and should not be relied upon for authoritative information.

Users and reviewers should not rely on third-party mirrors or unofficial pages for project details, to avoid any potential misrepresentation.
