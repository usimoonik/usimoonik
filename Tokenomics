### Tokenomics
- **Total Supply:** 999,000,000,000 USI (999.00B)
- **Decimals:** 18
- **Standard:** BEP-20
- **Network:** BNB Smart Chain (BSC)
- **Minting:** Permanently Disabled
- **Burning:** Not Implemented
- **Transaction Fees/Taxes:** 0% (No Buy/Sell Tax)
- **Administrative Controls:** None (No Owner Functions)

100% of the total token supply was created at the moment of contract deployment. No additional tokens can ever be minted, and the supply remains fixed forever.

The smart contract contains **no blacklist, pause, ownership override, or any administrative control mechanisms**. Once deployed, no entity — including the deployer — can modify contract behavior.

This design guarantees maximum transparency, predictability, and decentralization, with all properties fully verifiable on BSCScan and other blockchain explorers.

Tokenomics are **immutable and permanently set at deployment**, fully aligned with blockchain explorer transparency standards for community-driven utility tokens without financial mechanisms or promotional claims.

### Immutable Features Explained
The contract was intentionally designed without minting, burning, tax, or administrative functions. This ensures the token supply and behavior remain **fixed, predictable, and verifiable on-chain forever**.

Absence of any owner privileges means the contract is effectively renounced — no one can alter its functionality post-deployment. This follows best practices for transparent, community-driven tokens.

### Technical Specifications
- **Token Name:** USI Moonik Token
- **Token Symbol:** USI
- **Deployment Date:** December 2025
- **Initial & Maximum Supply:** 999,000,000,000 USI (fully allocated at genesis)
- **Transfer Functionality:** Standard BEP-20 compliant with no hooks, modifiers, or taxes
- **Auditability:** Full verified source code available on BSCScan for independent review

These specifications support transparent demonstration of core blockchain principles such as fixed-supply tokens, contract immutability, and decentralization — without any financial or investment implications.

### Compliance with Standards
The token fully adheres to the BEP-20 standard, ensuring seamless compatibility with BSC wallets, DEXs, and explorers.

No custom mechanisms or deviations that could suggest financial utility are present. All details are publicly verifiable to promote maximum transparency in accordance with explorer guidelines.

### Additional Notes on Predictability & Transparency
The completely fixed tokenomics eliminate any variability. Users can independently verify total supply, circulation, and transaction history directly on-chain at any time.

This structure is ideal for educational and community purposes, clearly demonstrating blockchain immutability and trustless design.
