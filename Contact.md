Contact & Project Responsibility
1. Introduction & Purpose
This page provides a comprehensive overview of the official contact channels, project responsibility, and human accountability for the USI Moonik Token (USI). It is designed to meet BscScan's requirements for clear information about the token and project, including transparent details on the founder and team members with supporting professional profiles (equivalents to LinkedIn, such as GitHub, Medium, and forum profiles). All information is factual, verifiable, and free from any misrepresentation of public entities or other projects.

The USI Moonik Token is a simple, educational BEP-20 token on the BNB Smart Chain, fully compliant with BEP-20 specifications. It features standard functions like transfer, balanceOf, and allowance, with no additional mechanisms. The project has no financial purpose, and no channel listed here is used for investment advice, price discussions, speculation, or financial activities. This ensures full transparency and prevents any potential misunderstanding.

2. Official Project Contact Channels
To ensure clear and verifiable communication, the following are the only official channels for the project. These are used exclusively for transparency, verification, and educational purposes, such as responding to BscScan inquiries or clarifying on-chain data.

Primary Contact Email (Official & Verified): usi@usimoonik.com – This domain-based email is owned and managed by the founder for all official correspondence.
Official Website: https://usimoonik.com – Hosts all transparency documents and project details.
Source Code Repository: https://github.com/usimoonik/usimoonik – Publicly available for code review and verification.
All official communications, including those for blockchain explorers like BscScan, documentation verification, or project identity confirmation, are conducted exclusively through these channels. Emails from non-domain addresses (e.g., Gmail or other providers) are not official and should be disregarded. This policy prevents impersonation and ensures authenticity.

3. Project Ownership & Human Responsibility
BscScan requires clear, transparent information about the project's responsible individuals. Below, we provide detailed, verifiable details about the founder, including their role and limitations. There is no misrepresentation of any public entities or other projects; all statements are original and factual.

Project Founder & Sole Owner:
usi moonik

The project founder is the original deployer of the USI Moonik smart contract and holds responsibility for:

Deployment and verification of the smart contract on BscScan (verified on 2025-12-04).
Accuracy and consistency of all public documentation, ensuring it aligns with on-chain data.
Maintenance of the official website, repositories, and transparency pages.
Communication with blockchain explorers, such as providing clarifications for BscScan reviews.
Ensuring the project remains non-financial and educational only.
From a technical and economic perspective, the founder does not possess the ability to:

Mint or burn tokens – no mint/burn functions in the contract.
Modify total supply – fixed at 999,000,000,000 tokens.
Freeze or restrict token transfers – no pause or blacklist features.
Introduce fees, taxes, or economic controls – fully BEP-20 compliant with no additions.
Alter user balances or interfere with transactions – contract is immutable.
This clear separation of human accountability (for documentation and verification) from on-chain control (which is none, as the contract is immutable) aligns with BscScan's transparency standards. The founder assumes full responsibility for the project's educational nature and non-misrepresentation.

4. Core Team Members & Defined Roles
To provide transparent information about the team, as required by BscScan, we list core members with their roles, responsibilities, and public professional profiles (equivalents to LinkedIn, including GitHub for technical work, Medium for articles, and forums like Bitcointalk for discussions). These profiles allow independent verification of their expertise in blockchain and documentation. The team is small, identifiable, and focused on non-financial support. No anonymous members exist, and there is no distortion of any public entities or projects.
