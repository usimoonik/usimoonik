## Project Ownership & Human Responsibility

**Project Founder & Sole Owner:**  
usi moonik

The project founder is the original deployer  
of the USI Moonik smart contract  
and holds responsibility for:

- Deployment and verification of the smart contract  
- Accuracy and consistency of public documentation  
- Maintenance of the official website and repositories  
- Communication with blockchain explorers  

From a technical and economic perspective,  
the founder does **not** possess the ability to:

- Mint or burn tokens  
- Modify total supply  
- Freeze or restrict token transfers  
- Introduce fees, taxes, or economic controls  

This distinction exists to clearly separate  
**human accountability**  
from  
**on-chain control**,  
in accordance with BscScan review standards.
