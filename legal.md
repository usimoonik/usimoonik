Legal Disclaimer & Full Project Transparency Statement
Non-Financial • Strictly Educational • Transparency-Only Blockchain Demonstration

1. Project Nature & Clear Identity – Repeated for Clarity
USI Moonik Token (symbol: USI) is a **fixed-supply, standard BEP-20 token** deployed on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). Contract address: 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef — source code **fully verified** on BscScan since December 04, 2025.

The project exists **solely** as an **educational and transparency-focused blockchain demonstration**. It is designed to show how a simple, immutable, minimal smart contract can operate predictably on a public network without hidden mechanics, taxes, minting, or financial features.

USI Moonik is **explicitly NOT**:

A commercial product, business, or service
A financial instrument, investment opportunity, or security
A fundraising mechanism, profit-sharing scheme, or yield generator
A utility token with real-world use cases beyond demonstration
**No** financial purpose, profit expectation, or commercial intent exists. This is repeated across the site to prevent any misinterpretation during BscScan review or by users.

2. Strong & Repeated Non-Investment / Non-Financial Statement
USI Moonik Token (USI) is **strictly non-financial** and **does not constitute** under any jurisdiction:

A security, share, equity, or ownership interest
An investment contract or opportunity
A derivative, commodity, financial instrument, or store of value
A speculative asset or profit-generating token
Any regulated financial product
**No** profits, yields, returns, appreciation, dividends, revenue share, or financial benefits are promised, implied, encouraged, or expected in any way — on this website, in documentation, social channels, or elsewhere.

The project has **never** and will **never** involve any form of investment solicitation, capital raising, or financial return mechanism. Holding or transferring USI provides **zero economic rights or entitlements**.

Repeated for BscScan clarity: This token is purely an **educational reference** — no financial product, no investment vehicle, no promise of value.

3. No Fundraising, No Sales, No Incentives – Absolute Confirmation
The USI Moonik project has **never** conducted and will **never** conduct:

ICO, IEO, IDO, fair launch, or any token offering/sale
Private/public presales, whitelists, or paid allocations
Any form of fundraising, donations, capital raising, or investment collection
Airdrops, giveaways, reward distributions, or incentive programs
Staking, farming, yield generation, or liquidity mining
No capital has been requested, accepted, or raised from any individual, entity, or community. The total supply (999,000,000,000 USI) was minted **once** at deployment — no further distribution or allocation exists.

This complete absence of fundraising is intentional to eliminate any perception of investment activity.

4. No Rights, Entitlements, or Claims – Explicit Disclaimer
Holding, transferring, or interacting with USI Moonik Token provides **absolutely no**:

Ownership rights or equity in any entity
Governance, voting, or decision-making rights
Dividends, revenue share, profit participation, or financial claims
Legal, contractual, or beneficial entitlements
Access to future features, airdrops, or rewards
USI carries **zero rights or entitlements** of any kind — it is purely a technical demonstration token.

5. No Services, No Custody, No Control – User Full Responsibility
USI Moonik provides **no services** whatsoever:

No custodial services or wallet management
No asset safekeeping or fund holding
No financial advice, investment guidance, or recommendations
No platform, app, or off-chain functionality
Users retain **100% control** of their own wallets, private keys, and funds at all times. The project **never** holds, controls, or accesses user assets.

All blockchain interactions are **user-initiated** and **user-responsible**. Users must understand and accept all blockchain risks (irreversibility, key loss, network issues, scams, etc.).
