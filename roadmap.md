Project Roadmap & Scope Declaration
Roadmap Purpose, Scope & Reviewer Clarification
This roadmap is published exclusively to address blockchain explorer review requirements, including those enforced by BscScan, with a focus on project clarity, identity transparency, and prevention of misleading expectations.

USI Moonik is not a startup, company, protocol, platform, ecosystem, or commercial venture of any kind. Accordingly, this roadmap does not describe growth, adoption, monetization, partnerships, or future expansion.

The function of this roadmap is purely documentary: to provide a verifiable historical and structural reference that clearly defines what actions have occurred, what is currently maintained, and what will explicitly never occur.

This document exists primarily for independent reviewers, auditors, and public verification processes, not for marketing or community promotion.

Roadmap Philosophy & Explicit Limitations
Unlike traditional blockchain roadmaps, the USI Moonik roadmap is intentionally descriptive rather than aspirational.

It does not include timelines for features, utility development, integration plans, or ecosystem growth, because none of those activities are part of the project’s scope.

This roadmap answers one precise question only:

What has been completed on-chain, what documentation is maintained, and which activities are permanently excluded.

This approach is chosen deliberately to avoid future-facing claims, implicit promises, or speculative narratives that frequently result in project rejection during explorer reviews.

Phase 1 – Smart Contract Deployment & On-Chain Finalization (Completed)
Phase 1 consisted exclusively of deploying a clean, standard-compliant BEP-20 smart contract on the BNB Smart Chain.

The contract was deployed with a permanently fixed total supply of 999,000,000,000 USI, defined at the moment of deployment and immutable thereafter.

No proxy contracts, no upgrade mechanisms, no delayed initialization logic, and no post-deployment control paths were included.

No minting or supply expansion functions
No burn, deflation, or balance manipulation logic
No transaction fees, taxes, or redistribution
No blacklist, whitelist, freeze, or pause features
No administrative privileges after deployment
The smart contract source code was publicly verified on BscScan on December 04, 2025, allowing independent bytecode comparison and permanent inspection.

This phase is complete, irreversible, and cannot be altered by the project creator or any external party.

Phase 2 – Documentation, Identity Disclosure & Public Traceability (Completed)
Phase 2 focused entirely on transparency, identity clarity, and alignment between off-chain documentation and on-chain reality.

The official website was published as a static, non-interactive informational resource. It contains no applications, no financial interfaces, no wallet connections, and no user onboarding systems.

Public documentation published during this phase includes:

Clear project and token descriptions
Explicit non-investment and non-commercial statements
Founder responsibility and accountability disclosure
Consistency checks between website content and blockchain data
Communication channels exist solely for public traceability and verification of identity, not for marketing, fundraising, or community incentives.

Phase 3 – Ongoing Documentation Integrity (Ongoing)
Phase 3 is strictly limited to documentation maintenance and clarity improvements.

Refining explanatory language when necessary
Ensuring accuracy and consistency across public materials
Responding to blockchain explorer review feedback
No technical changes, contract updates, feature additions, or integrations are possible or planned during this phase.

Explicit Non-Roadmap & Permanent Exclusions
No investment or profit-oriented utility
No staking, farming, yield, or reward mechanisms
No governance systems or voting rights
No exchange listings, partnerships, or integrations
No foundations, DAOs, or external organizations
No representation of any public or private institution
These exclusions are intentional, permanent, and documented to prevent misinterpretation, false expectations, or association with unrelated projects.

Verification, Accuracy & Originality Statement
All statements within this roadmap are independently verifiable through:

Immutable on-chain data on the BNB Smart Chain
Verified smart contract source code on BscScan
Public website content and version history
No information in this roadmap is copied from, derived from, or representative of other blockchain projects, companies, or public institutions.

Final Compliance & Disclosure Statement
This roadmap is published solely for transparency, educational reference, and blockchain explorer compliance.

It does not constitute an offer, solicitation, forecast, or representation of future value, activity, or development.
