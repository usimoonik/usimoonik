# Roadmap & Scope Declaration

**USI Moonik Token (USI) – Strictly Educational & Transparency-Only Project**

## 1. Roadmap Purpose, Scope & Explicit Reviewer Clarification

This roadmap is published exclusively to satisfy blockchain explorer review requirements — particularly BscScan — by providing maximum clarity, complete transparency, and prevention of any misleading expectations. It details the token's technical structure, completed steps, and permanent limitations in simple, verifiable terms.

The USI Moonik Token is a standard BEP-20 token on the BNB Smart Chain, fully compliant with BEP-20 specifications (transfer, balance, approval functions only). USI Moonik is not a startup, company, protocol, platform, ecosystem, DeFi project, game, metaverse, or commercial venture of any kind. It is a static, immutable, educational blockchain reference token with no financial or utility features.

Therefore, this roadmap does not describe:

- Future features or development plans – Nothing beyond education.
- Growth, adoption, marketing, or community incentives – No promotions.
- Monetization, partnerships, exchange listings, or integrations – No financial ties.
- Utility expansion, upgrades, or ecosystem building – Immutable design.

Its only function is documentary:

- What has been completed on-chain (immutable facts, verifiable on BscScan).
- What documentation and identity disclosure are maintained (team profiles included).
- What activities are permanently excluded and will never occur (to avoid speculation).

This structure is deliberate to avoid future-facing claims, implicit promises, or speculative narratives that could cause rejection during explorer reviews. All statements are factual and non-misleading.

## 2. Roadmap Philosophy & Permanent Scope Limitations

Unlike traditional blockchain projects, the USI Moonik roadmap is descriptive only — never aspirational or forward-looking. It focuses on what is already verifiable, ensuring compliance with BscScan's emphasis on transparency and non-misrepresentation.

It answers one precise question:

What has been permanently finalized on-chain, what minimal documentation is maintained, and which activities are explicitly and forever excluded?

This philosophy eliminates:

- Timelines for non-existent features – No development planned.
- Promises of utility, adoption, or value – Educational only.
- Any perception of future development or commercial intent – Static project.

The project is intentionally static after deployment — no changes, no additions, no evolution. This is a core transparency feature, with the contract immutable and BEP-20 compliant.

## Phase 1 – Smart Contract Deployment & On-Chain Finalization (Completed)

This phase covers the initial and final technical creation of the token, all verifiable on-chain.

- Contract Deployment: Deployed on BNB Smart Chain with address 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef – Fully BEP-20 compliant.
- Source Code Verification: Verified on BscScan on 2025-12-04 – Public for audits.
- Supply Minting: Fixed supply of 999,000,000,000 USI minted once – No further creation.
- Immutability Lock: No upgrade paths or proxies – Code permanent.

No financial actions occurred; phase focused on educational demonstration.

## Phase 2 – Transparency Documentation & Identity Disclosure (Completed)

This phase involved publishing verifiable documents and team details.

- Whitepaper & Clarifications: Published non-financial docs on website.
- Team Disclosure: Founder (usi moonik) and members (amob animo, houno minp) with profiles (X, GitHub, etc.).
- Social Channels: Set up for transparency only (no promotion).

All materials are factual and BscScan-compliant.

## Phase 3 – Ongoing Documentation Integrity & Transparency Maintenance (Ongoing – Minimal)

Phase 3 is strictly limited to:

- Minor language refinements for clarity when required by reviewers (e.g., BscScan feedback).
- Ensuring continued accuracy and consistency across public materials – No new content implying value.
- Responding to blockchain explorer feedback – Educational clarifications only.

No technical changes, contract modifications, feature additions, integrations, or development are possible or planned. The project remains frozen.

## Permanent Exclusions & Explicit Non-Roadmap (Never Planned, Never Possible)

The following are permanently excluded from the USI Moonik project — they will never occur:

- Any form of investment, profit, yield, or financial return mechanism – Non-financial.
- Staking, farming, liquidity mining, rewards, airdrops, or incentives – No economics.
- Governance, voting, DAO, or user rights/entitlements – No community control.
- Exchange listings, partnerships, integrations, or collaborations – Independent project.
- Foundations, companies, DAOs, or external organizations – Small team only.
- Upgrades, new features, smart contract changes, or proxy implementations – Immutable.
- Marketing, promotion, community building, or hype campaigns – Transparency focus.
- Any claim of affiliation with Binance, BNB Chain, or third parties – No distortions.

These exclusions are intentional, permanent, and documented to prevent misinterpretation, false expectations, or association with unrelated projects, ensuring BscScan compliance.

## Verification, Accuracy, Originality & Independence

All roadmap statements are independently verifiable through:

- Immutable on-chain data on BNB Smart Chain – Contract address provided.
- Verified smart contract source code on BscScan – No hidden code.
- Public website content and historical consistency – Original materials.

All information is 100% original — no copying from other projects, templates, public entities, or institutions. The project is fully independent — no affiliation with Binance, BNB Chain, BscScan, Trust Wallet, or any third-party organization.

## Final Compliance & Disclosure Statement

This roadmap exists solely for transparency, educational reference, and blockchain explorer compliance (especially BscScan).

It does not constitute an offer, solicitation, forecast, roadmap of development, or representation of future value, activity, or utility.

USI Moonik Token is a completed, immutable, educational demonstration — nothing more.
