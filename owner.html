  <h3 class="gold-subtitle">Proof of Ownership for Blockchain Explorers</h3>
  <p>
    To prove real ownership and authenticity to BscScan (and ensure full compliance):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The contract was deployed and is controlled from the wallet associated with the founder.</li>
    <li>Source code is fully verified on BscScan (date: 2025-12-04).</li>
    <li>All social channels, GitHub, and website are directly managed by the founder/team.</li>
    <li>Official email (usi@usimoonik.com) is domain-based and used for all explorer communications.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If BscScan requires additional proof (e.g., signing a message with the deployer wallet to verify address ownership), please contact us via the official email. We are ready to complete the "Verify Contract Address Ownership" process on BscScan (signing a message via MetaMask or similar wallet) to tie the contract to our account and enable official updates like logo, social links, and info.
  </p>

  <p>
    This page serves as a clear, public declaration of ownership and accountability in accordance with blockchain explorer transparency standards.
