Project Ownership, Control & Accountability Disclosure
USI Moonik Token (USI) – BNB Smart Chain – Full Public Responsibility Proof

1. Clear Project Definition & Maximum Transparency Statement
USI Moonik (ticker: USI) is a **standard BEP-20 token** deployed on BNB Smart Chain — **not** a company, foundation, DAO, investment platform, or legal entity. It is a **transparent, independent, educational on-chain demonstration** with **full human accountability**.

This page specifically addresses BscScan/explorer requirements for:

Clear, non-anonymous project ownership
Identifiable founder and team with verifiable profiles
Accurate, truthful, non-misleading information
Elimination of anonymity or hidden control ambiguity
All content is **original, project-specific**, and **not derived/copied** from any external entity/project.

2. Definition of Ownership – Technical & Accountability Only
"Owner" here means **strictly limited technical/accountability role**:

Individual who deployed the contract
Submitted/verified source code on BscScan (2025-12-04)
Maintains website/documentation
Primary contact for transparency reviews
Ownership **does NOT** include:

Financial custody or user fund control
Ability to alter supply/balances/transfers
Governance or custodial powers
This prevents confusion between deployment responsibility and prohibited financial control.

3. Explicit Absence of DAO, Multisig, Hidden Control or Third Parties
USI Moonik is **not** governed or influenced by any collective/anonymous structure.

Confirmed absence of:

DAO, multisig wallets, shared control
Anonymous clusters or external admins
Companies, foundations, trusts
Off-chain voting or indirect mechanisms
Accountability is **directly traceable** to named individuals — aligned with BscScan expectations.
