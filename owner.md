Project Ownership, Control & Accountability Disclosure
USI Moonik Token (USI) – BNB Smart Chain

1. Clear Project Definition & Transparency Statement
USI Moonik (ticker: USI) is a blockchain-based digital token deployed on the
BNB Smart Chain (BSC). This project is not a company, not a foundation, and not
a registered legal entity. It is a transparent, independently developed
on-chain token project with clearly identified human responsibility.

This page exists specifically to address blockchain explorer (BscScan)
requirements regarding:
- Clear project ownership
- Identifiable founder and responsible individuals
- Accurate, non-misleading disclosures
- Elimination of anonymity-related ambiguity

All information presented here is original, project-specific,
and not copied, reused, or derived from other public entities,
projects, or institutions.

2. Definition of Ownership (Technical & Accountability Scope)
Within the USI Moonik project, the term "Owner" has a strictly limited,
technical, and accountability-based meaning.

The Project Owner is defined exclusively as:
- The individual who deployed the USI Moonik smart contract on BNB Smart Chain
- The individual who submitted and verified the contract source code on BscScan
- The individual responsible for maintaining official documentation and disclosures
- The accountable contact person for explorer reviews and transparency checks

Ownership does not mean:
- Financial custody of user funds
- Administrative control over token holders
- Governance authority over users or wallets
- Permission to alter balances, supply, or transfers

This distinction is explicitly stated to prevent any misunderstanding between
technical deployment responsibility and prohibited financial or custodial control.

3. Explicit Absence of DAO, Multisig, or Hidden Control
USI Moonik is not operated, governed, or influenced by any collective,
anonymous, or third-party structure.

The project explicitly confirms the absence of:
- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO)
- Multisignature wallets
- Shared or committee-based control
- Anonymous wallet clusters
- External administrators or automation frameworks
- Companies, foundations, trusts, or legal entities

There are no hidden governance layers, no off-chain voting,
and no indirect mechanisms capable of influencing
the token’s behavior or user balances.

All accountability is intentionally traceable to identified individuals,
in alignment with BscScan’s transparency expectations.

4. Founder & Project Owner – Identified Individual
Founder & Project Owner:
usi moonik

The Founder & Project Owner is the sole individual who:
- Created and deployed the USI Moonik smart contract
- Verified the contract source code on BscScan
- Maintains the official project website and documentation
- Ensures accuracy of all public disclosures
- Acts as the accountable human reference for the project

This role exists strictly for responsibility and traceability purposes.
It does not grant discretionary authority over the token,
its supply, or its holders.

5. On-Chain Technical Authority – Explicit Limitations
The USI Moonik smart contract is designed with strict,
hard-coded limitations that apply permanently,
including to the Project Owner.

The Project Owner cannot:
- Mint or create new tokens
- Burn or destroy existing tokens
- Freeze, blacklist, or restrict any wallet
- Modify balances or force transfers
- Pause, disable, or upgrade the token
- Add taxes, fees, or hidden deductions

These restrictions are enforced entirely by the smart contract code
and do not rely on promises, policies, or off-chain statements.

The only remaining owner-level capability is:
- Non-financial metadata updates (such as token name or symbol)

Such updates have no impact on supply, balances, or transfers
and are fully transparent on-chain through emitted events.

6. Core Team Members – Identified & Limited Roles
USI Moonik is supported by a small, publicly disclosed core team.
All team roles are strictly off-chain and non-financial.
