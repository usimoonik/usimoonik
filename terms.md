**No** statements, texts, graphics, or communications on this website or related channels shall be interpreted as marketing, promotion, solicitation, invitation, or encouragement to acquire, hold, trade, or speculate on the token for financial, speculative, or profit-seeking purposes.

This clarification is **repeated multiple times** across the site to **eliminate any possible ambiguity** during BscScan review, third-party compliance checks, or user interpretation.

## 2. Strong Non-Financial Declaration – No Investment, No Fundraising, No Promises

USI Moonik Token (USI) is **not** a security, share, stock, bond, derivative, commodity, investment contract, or any form of regulated financial instrument under any jurisdiction.
