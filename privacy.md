Privacy Policy & Full Project Transparency
0. Project Identity & Scope Declaration
USI Moonik is an independent blockchain-based token project deployed on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC).

The project exists solely as a decentralized digital token and an informational website intended to document its structure, philosophy, and technical presence.

USI Moonik is not a registered company, not a financial institution, not an investment platform, and not a service provider.

No promises of profit, revenue generation, dividends, or financial return are made, implied, or suggested anywhere within this website or related materials.

This section exists specifically to eliminate ambiguity during BscScan or third-party compliance reviews regarding the nature, intent, and boundaries of the project.

1. Founder & Team Transparency Statement
USI Moonik is a founder-led, independently managed project.

The project is developed and maintained by an individual or small private group operating without public-facing corporate structure.

There is intentionally no publicly listed team page, executive board, or corporate registry because:

The project does not solicit investments or public funding
No trust-based custodial services are provided
No user assets are controlled by the team
No off-chain user interaction or dependency exists
To avoid misinformation or identity fabrication, the project does not publish placeholder names, fake team profiles, or borrowed LinkedIn accounts.

This approach is chosen deliberately to prevent the use of misleading or unverifiable personal data, which is a common reason for project rejection during explorer reviews.

Responsibility for the smart contract and website content remains with the original deployer and maintainer of the project.

2. Original Content & Non-Affiliation Declaration
All information published on this website is written exclusively for the USI Moonik project.

Any government entity
Any financial regulator
Any exchange or launchpad
Any similarly named project or brand
Any resemblance to external projects or terminology is purely coincidental and does not indicate partnership, endorsement, or inheritance of credibility.

This explicit declaration exists to prevent assumptions of misrepresentation or data reuse during BscScan verification.

The website does not collect, request, infer, or analyze any form of personal or behavioral data.
