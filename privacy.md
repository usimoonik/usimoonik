# Privacy Policy & Full Project Transparency Declaration

## 0. Project Identity, Scope & Clear Definition – Repeated for Maximum Clarity

USI Moonik Token (symbol: USI) is a **standard, immutable BEP-20 token** deployed exclusively on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). The contract address is 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef, with source code **fully verified** on BscScan since December 04, 2025.

This project exists **solely** as a **decentralized digital token** and a **static informational website** to document its technical structure, minimal design philosophy, immutability, and on-chain presence for educational purposes.

USI Moonik is **explicitly NOT**:

- A registered company, foundation, DAO, or legal entity
- A financial institution, investment platform, or service provider
- A fundraising mechanism, profit-sharing scheme, or yield-generating asset
- A commercial product or utility with off-chain dependencies

**No** promises of profit, revenue, dividends, price appreciation, financial returns, or investment outcomes are made, implied, or suggested anywhere on this site or in related materials. The token is **strictly educational** — demonstrating how a simple, fixed-supply BEP-20 token operates predictably on a public blockchain.

**Key immutable facts (verifiable on BscScan):**

- Total Supply: Exactly 999,000,000,000 USI (999 billion) – permanently fixed, no minting possible
- Decimals: 18
- No taxes, fees, reflections, blacklists, or pause functions
- No upgradeable logic – contract is final and immutable

This section is deliberately repeated and detailed to **eliminate any ambiguity** during BscScan or third-party compliance reviews regarding the project's nature, intent, boundaries, and non-financial status.

## 1. Founder, Team & Full Accountability Disclosure – Public Professional Profiles

USI Moonik is a **founder-led, non-anonymous, independently managed educational project**. Full responsibility lies with identifiable individuals — no hidden operators, DAOs, or third-party controllers.

To ensure maximum transparency and satisfy BscScan requirements for clear identification:

- **Founder & Project Owner:** usi moonik – original deployer, contract verifier, website maintainer, primary accountable contact. Email: usi@usimoonik.com

These profiles are **public professional channels** in Web3 (X for announcements, GitHub for contributions, etc.) — equivalent to LinkedIn for blockchain contributors. No anonymous members exist; all are publicly tied to the project.

## 2. Privacy Philosophy & Absolute Zero Data Collection Policy

USI Moonik prioritizes **maximum user privacy** by design — the project collects, stores, processes, or analyzes **absolutely zero personal or identifying data** from visitors or users.

This is possible because:

- The site is **purely static/informational** — no user interactions, forms, logins, or dynamic content.
- All token activity happens **directly on-chain** via users' own wallets — no intermediary or custody.
- No third-party services (analytics, tracking, ads) are used.

We **do not** and **cannot** know who visits the site, interacts with the contract, or holds/transfers tokens. Privacy is enforced technically, not just by policy.

## 3. No Third-Party Services, No Tracking – Strict Isolation

To ensure **zero data leakage**:

- **No** Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, or any tracking scripts
- **No** Cloudflare, AWS, or analytics-enabled hosting
- **No** embedded YouTube, social buttons, or external iframes
- **No** ad networks, affiliate links, or monetization tools
- **No** server-side user profiling or logging of personal info

The site loads **only** from its own domain — no cross-site requests that could track.

## 4. No Personal Data Collected – Complete List

We **do not collect, store, process, infer, or analyze** any personal or behavioral data whatsoever.

**Explicitly not** collected:

- Names, emails, addresses, or identifiers
- IP addresses for profiling (only transient server logs if any, never stored/used)
- Device/browser fingerprints, user agents for tracking
- Geolocation, time zones, or session data
- Analytics metrics, visit counts, heatmaps, or usage patterns
- Wallet addresses, transaction data, or blockchain interactions (handled directly on-chain)

**No** databases, cookies for identification, local storage for tracking, or third-party embeds exist.

## 5. Zero Cookies, Zero Tracking, Zero Analytics

**No cookies** are set or used for any purpose — no tracking, no advertising, no session management, no preferences.

**No** third-party scripts, pixels, beacons, Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, Cloudflare analytics, or any monitoring services are loaded.

The site is served as **pure static HTML/CSS** — no JavaScript required for core functionality, no external dependencies that track.

## 6. Blockchain Interactions – Public & Independent

All token-related activity (transfers, balances) occurs **directly on BNB Smart Chain** via users' own wallets.

This website **does not** create, store, control, or access blockchain data — it only links to public explorers like BscScan for verification.

Users interact **peer-to-peer** with the immutable contract — no intermediary, no custody by project maintainers.

## 7. Technical Architecture – Pure Static & Minimal

This is a **100% static informational website** hosted on a simple server or CDN.

**No** backend servers, APIs, databases, user authentication, forms, or dynamic content generation exist.

No server-side logging of personal data occurs — only standard HTTP access logs (if any) are transient and not used for profiling.

## 8. Purpose of This Document – BscScan Compliance & Transparency

This privacy & transparency declaration is published **specifically** to satisfy blockchain explorer requirements (including BscScan) for:

- Complete project clarity and non-financial intent
- Accurate, non-misleading disclosures
- Clear responsibility/accountability via public profiles
- Proof of privacy respect and zero data practices

It eliminates uncertainty, prevents misinterpretation, and confirms the project as a **transparent, educational, immutable BEP-20 demonstration** — nothing more.
