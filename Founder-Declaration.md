Founder Declaration, Identity & Legal Responsibility
Official Statement by usi moonik – Maximum Transparency & Accountability for BscScan Review

1. Formal Founder Declaration & Identity Confirmation
I, usi moonik, as the founder, sole project owner, smart contract deployer, and primary responsible individual, hereby formally and publicly declare that I am the real, identifiable, and accountable person behind the USI Moonik Token (USI) project.

The USI Moonik project is not operated by any anonymous group, decentralized organization (DAO), external company, shell entity, proxy operator, or undisclosed controlling party. All responsibility — technical, legal, transparency, and documentation — rests directly with me and the openly disclosed core team members.

This declaration is published specifically to remove every possible uncertainty, ambiguity, or doubt regarding authorship, ownership, control, and human accountability for blockchain explorers (especially BscScan), reviewers, and the public.

2. Founder Roles, Direct Responsibilities & Accountability
As the identified founder and owner, I accept full, personal, and direct responsibility for every aspect of the USI Moonik project, including but not limited to:

Design, writing, deployment, and public source code verification of the USI smart contract on BNB Smart Chain (verified on BscScan December 04, 2025)
Ensuring complete immutability, absence of mint/burn/tax/pause/upgrade functions, and removal of any hidden or privileged controls
Accuracy, truthfulness, consistency, and originality of all public documentation, website content, and disclosures
Ownership, operation, and maintenance of the official website: https://usimoonik.com
Management, updates, and transparency of official GitHub repositories
Control, moderation, and factual accuracy of all official communication channels
Coordination with the openly identified core team members (listed below)
No operational authority, contract control, decision-making power, or responsibility is delegated to any anonymous person, third-party service, marketing agency, shell company, or undisclosed entity.

This level of direct accountability is intentional to fully comply with BscScan and explorer transparency standards.

3. Strong & Repeated Non-Financial / Non-Commercial Declaration
I confirm that the USI Moonik Token (USI) is strictly non-financial and is not designed or operated as any form of:

Security, investment, equity, share, or financial instrument
Profit-generating asset, yield-bearing token, or revenue-sharing mechanism
Commercial product, service, or utility platform
Fundraising tool, ICO/IDO/presale vehicle, or capital-raising initiative
The project has never and will never engage in:

Any token sales, distributions, airdrops, or offerings
Any fundraising, donations, or capital collection
Any staking, yield farming, rewards, or incentive programs
Any promotion of speculation, trading, or financial expectations
No promises or implications of price appreciation, returns, profits, or economic benefits exist anywhere in the project. This is repeated to eliminate any possible misinterpretation.

4. Core Team Members – Full Public Disclosure with Profiles
In addition to my direct responsibility as founder, the project is supported by a small, fully disclosed core team of named individuals with multiple public professional profiles (standard in Web3: X for visibility, GitHub for code, Telegram for communication, Bitcointalk for forums, Medium for articles — equivalents to LinkedIn).

Their roles are limited to transparency support, documentation accuracy, and educational consistency — no financial or operational control.
