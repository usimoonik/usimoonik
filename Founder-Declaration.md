# Founder Declaration, Identity & Legal Responsibility

**Official Statement by usi moonik – Maximum Transparency & Accountability for BscScan Review**

## 1. Formal Founder Declaration & Identity Confirmation

I, usi moonik, as the **founder, sole project owner, smart contract deployer, and primary responsible individual**, hereby formally and publicly declare that I am the **real, identifiable, and accountable person** behind the USI Moonik Token (USI) project.

The USI Moonik project is **not** operated by any anonymous group, decentralized organization (DAO), external company, shell entity, proxy operator, or undisclosed controlling party. **All responsibility** — technical, legal, transparency, and documentation — rests directly with me and the openly disclosed core team members.

This declaration is published **specifically** to remove every possible uncertainty, ambiguity, or doubt regarding authorship, ownership, control, and human accountability for blockchain explorers (especially BscScan), reviewers, and the public.

## 2. Founder Roles, Direct Responsibilities & Accountability

As the identified founder and owner, I accept **full, personal, and direct responsibility** for every aspect of the USI Moonik project, including but not limited to:

- Design, writing, deployment, and public source code verification of the USI smart contract on BNB Smart Chain (verified on BscScan December 04, 2025)
- Ensuring complete immutability, absence of mint/burn/tax/pause/upgrade functions, and removal of any hidden or privileged controls
- Accuracy, truthfulness, consistency, and originality of all public documentation, website content, and disclosures
- Ownership, operation, and maintenance of the official website: https://usimoonik.com
- Management, updates, and transparency of official GitHub repositories
- Control, moderation, and factual accuracy of all official communication channels
- Coordination with the openly identified core team members (listed below)

**No operational authority, contract control, decision-making power, or responsibility** is delegated to any anonymous person, third-party service, marketing agency, shell company, or undisclosed entity.

This level of direct accountability is intentional to fully comply with BscScan and explorer transparency standards.

## 3. Strong & Repeated Non-Financial / Non-Commercial Declaration

I confirm that the USI Moonik Token (USI) is **strictly non-financial** and is **not** designed or operated as any form of:

- Financial instrument, security, investment contract, or speculative asset
- Fundraising vehicle, capital raising mechanism, or profit-oriented project
- Commercial offering, utility token with real-world services, or business product

The project has **never** and will **never** involve:

- ICO, IEO, IDO, token sale, presale, or any form of offering for payment
- Staking, yield farming, rewards, airdrops, or incentive programs
- Profit-sharing, dividends, revenue distribution, or financial returns
- Price guarantees, value projections, market promises, or speculation encouragement

The token exists **solely** as an **educational and transparency-oriented blockchain reference** for learning, public inspection, and verification of immutable smart contract behavior.

Repeated for clarity: No financial purpose, no investment intent, no profit expectation — purely educational.

## 4. Identified Core Team & Public Professional Profiles

The project is supported by a small, fully disclosed core team who contribute in **non-commercial, technical, and transparency-focused roles only**. All members are **non-anonymous** and provide **multiple public professional profiles** (standard in Web3/blockchain as equivalents to LinkedIn).
