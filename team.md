# Team Transparency & Responsibility Disclosure

**USI Moonik Token (USI) – BNB Smart Chain – Maximum Public Accountability, Verifiable Identities & Strict Educational Purpose Page**

## 1. Transparency Commitment – Maximum Openness & Verifiability

This dedicated transparency page is created specifically to provide the **most explicit, detailed, and independently verifiable** identification of every single individual who has any responsibility for maintaining, documenting, or supporting the USI Moonik Token project.

In full accordance with blockchain best practices, public disclosure standards, and especially the transparency and accountability requirements often requested by platforms like BscScan (for token verification, listing, or audit purposes), **USI Moonik operates in a completely non-anonymous manner**. Every person with any defined role is publicly named right here, and each provides multiple **accessible, public, professional-oriented profiles** that anyone can check at any time.

There are **absolutely no** hidden operators, secret administrators, undisclosed controllers, shadow developers, anonymous moderators, or any other unlisted participants who have influence or access to the project. **Only** the exact individuals listed on this page — with their full roles clearly explained — have any official connection or responsibility. This level of openness is intentional to build trust through facts that can be independently confirmed on public platforms.

Repeated for emphasis: The project has zero anonymous elements. All contributors are publicly disclosed here with links to their real, active profiles where their work and identity can be seen.

## 2. Project Structure (Strictly Non-Corporate, Non-Financial Model) – Detailed Explanation

USI Moonik Token is **not** a registered company, not a startup, not a DAO, not an investment platform, not a financial service, and not any form of profit-oriented entity. It is purely and strictly an **independently maintained educational blockchain demonstration project** focused on showing how a simple, immutable, fully transparent BEP-20 token can exist on a public network like BNB Smart Chain.

Because of this clear non-commercial nature, the project has **none** of the following:

- No shareholders or equity holders
- No venture capital, angel investors, or any external funding
- No token sales team, marketing team, or business development staff
- No financial managers, treasuries, or revenue collection
- No custodial services, wallet management, or user fund handling
- No profit-sharing, dividend rights, or revenue distribution mechanisms

All responsibilities are **very narrowly limited** to only the following areas: technical smart contract deployment and verification, open-source code maintenance, educational documentation, and public transparency disclosures (including this page).

The project does **not** have any financial, commercial, governance, or investment-related roles — and never will. This structure is designed to eliminate any possible confusion or misinterpretation about the project's non-speculative, non-profit nature.
