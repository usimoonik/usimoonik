Team Transparency & Responsibility Disclosure
USI Moonik Token (USI) – BNB Smart Chain – Maximum Public Accountability, Verifiable Identities & Strict Educational Purpose Page

1. Transparency Commitment – Maximum Openness & Verifiability
This dedicated transparency page is created specifically to provide the **most explicit, detailed, and independently verifiable** identification of every single individual who has any responsibility for maintaining, documenting, or supporting the USI Moonik Token project.

In full accordance with blockchain best practices, public disclosure standards, and especially the transparency and accountability requirements often requested by platforms like BscScan (for token verification, listing, or audit purposes), **USI Moonik operates in a completely non-anonymous manner**. Every person with any defined role is publicly named right here, and each provides multiple **accessible, public, professional-oriented profiles** that anyone can check at any time.

There are **absolutely no** hidden operators, secret administrators, undisclosed controllers, shadow developers, anonymous moderators, or any other unlisted participants who have influence or access to the project. **Only** the exact individuals listed on this page — with their full roles clearly explained — have any official connection or responsibility. This level of openness is intentional to build trust through facts that can be independently confirmed on public platforms.

Repeated for emphasis: The project has zero anonymous elements. All contributors are publicly disclosed here with links to their real, active profiles where their work and identity can be seen.

2. Project Structure (Strictly Non-Corporate, Non-Financial Model) – Detailed Explanation
USI Moonik Token is **not** a registered company, not a startup, not a DAO, not an investment platform, not a financial service, and not any form of profit-oriented entity. It is purely and strictly an **independently maintained educational blockchain demonstration project** focused on showing how a simple, immutable, fully transparent BEP-20 token can exist on a public network like BNB Smart Chain.

Because of this clear non-commercial nature, the project has **none** of the following:

No shareholders or equity holders
No venture capital, angel investors, or any external funding
No token sales team, marketing team, or business development staff
No financial managers, treasuries, or revenue collection
No custodial services, wallet management, or user fund handling
No profit-sharing, dividend rights, or revenue distribution mechanisms
All responsibilities are **very narrowly limited** to only the following areas: technical smart contract deployment and verification, open-source code maintenance, public documentation writing, website content accuracy, transparency updates, and educational explanation of how the token works on-chain. **No team member has any financial authority or control over user assets**.

This structure is deliberately kept minimal to eliminate any possible confusion about the project's purely educational and transparency-focused purpose.

3. Founder & Project Owner – Full Public Disclosure
Name: usi moonik
Role: Project Founder, Smart Contract Deployer, Domain & Website Owner, Primary Official Contact Point, Overall Project Accountability Holder

The founder is responsible for:

Initial creation and deployment of the USI smart contract on BNB Smart Chain
Verification of the source code on BscScan (completed and public since 2025-12-04)
Ownership and maintenance of the official domain and website
Serving as the main public contact for any transparency or technical questions
Ensuring the project remains strictly educational with no financial promises
Important repeated limitations: The founder has **no control** over user wallets, user balances, token supply (fixed forever), or any economic mechanics. The contract owner privilege is extremely limited and cannot mint, burn, freeze, tax, seize, or alter the token in any way.

4. Core Team Members – Extremely Detailed Roles, Limitations & Public Profiles
Every core contributor has **very clearly defined and strictly limited duties**. No one has broad powers. All profiles are public, active in the Web3 space, and verifiable (think of them as equivalents to LinkedIn in traditional industries — in blockchain, X, GitHub, Telegram, Medium, and Bitcointalk are standard ways developers and contributors prove identity and work).
