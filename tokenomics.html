  <ul>
    <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 999,000,000,000 USI (999.00B)</li>
    <li><strong>Decimals:</strong> 18</li>
    <li><strong>Standard:</strong> BEP-20</li>
    <li><strong>Network:</strong> BNB Smart Chain (BSC)</li>
    <li><strong>Minting:</strong> Permanently Disabled</li>
    <li><strong>Burning:</strong> Not Implemented</li>
    <li><strong>Transaction Fees/Taxes:</strong> 0% (No Buy/Sell Tax)</li>
    <li><strong>Administrative Controls:</strong> None (No Owner Functions)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    100% of the total token supply was created at the moment of contract deployment. No additional tokens can ever be minted, and the supply remains fixed forever.
  </p>

  <p>
    The smart contract contains <strong>no blacklist, pause, ownership override, or any administrative control mechanisms</strong>. Once deployed, no entity — including the deployer — can modify contract behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    This design guarantees maximum transparency, predictability, and decentralization, with all properties fully verifiable on BSCScan and other blockchain explorers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tokenomics are <strong>immutable and permanently set at deployment</strong>, fully aligned with blockchain explorer transparency standards for community-driven utility tokens without financial mechanisms or promotional claims.
  </p>

  <h3>Immutable Features Explained</h3>
  <p>
    The contract was intentionally designed without minting, burning, tax, or administrative functions. This ensures the token supply and behavior remain <strong>fixed, predictable, and verifiable on-chain forever</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Absence of any owner privileges means the contract is effectively renounced — no one can alter its functionality post-deployment. This follows best practices for transparent, community-driven tokens.
  </p>

  <h3>Technical Specifications</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Token Name:</strong> USI Moonik Token</li>
    <li><strong>Token Symbol:</strong> USI</li>
    <li><strong>Deployment Date:</strong> December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Initial & Maximum Supply:</strong> 999,000,000,000 USI (fully allocated at genesis)</li>
    <li><strong>Transfer Functionality:</strong> Standard BEP-20 compliant with no hooks, modifiers, or taxes</li>
    <li><strong>Auditability:</strong> Full verified source code available on BSCScan for independent review</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These specifications support transparent demonstration of core blockchain principles such as fixed-supply tokens, contract immutability, and decentralization — without any financial or investment implications.
  </p>

  <h3>Compliance with Standards</h3>
  <p>
    The token fully adheres to the BEP-20 standard, ensuring seamless compatibility with BSC wallets, DEXs, and explorers.
  </p>

  <p>
    No custom mechanisms or deviations that could suggest financial utility are present. All details are publicly verifiable to promote maximum transparency in accordance with explorer guidelines.
  </p>

  <h3>Additional Notes on Predictability & Transparency</h3>
  <p>
    The completely fixed tokenomics eliminate any variability. Users can independently verify total supply, circulation, and transaction history directly on-chain at any time.
  </p>

  <p>
    This structure is ideal for educational and community purposes, clearly demonstrating blockchain immutability and trustless design.
