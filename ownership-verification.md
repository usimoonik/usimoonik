Cryptographic Ownership & Deployer Verification
USI Moonik Token (USI) – BNB Smart Chain

1. Purpose, Context & Transparency Motivation
This page exists exclusively to provide clear, technical, and cryptographically
verifiable evidence linking the USI Moonik token smart contract to its declared
human project owner.

This disclosure directly addresses common blockchain explorer review concerns,
including but not limited to:
- Lack of clear project ownership
- Absence of accountable human identity
- Reliance on unverifiable or trust-based claims
- Potential reuse or misrepresentation of third-party information

Instead of relying on statements, promises, or screenshots,
this page uses standard blockchain cryptography
to mathematically prove deployer wallet control.

All information on this page is specific to the USI Moonik project
and is not copied, adapted, or derived from any external entity,
public institution, or unrelated blockchain project.

2. Explanation of Cryptographic Verification (Non-Technical)
Blockchain networks rely on asymmetric cryptography,
where control over a wallet is proven
by the ability to generate a valid digital signature
using a private key.

Private keys are never revealed, shared, or exposed.
Instead, the wallet owner signs a human-readable message.

Anyone can independently verify that:
- The message was signed by a specific wallet address
- The signature is mathematically valid
- The signer must control the private key of that address

This method is globally recognized as the highest standard
for on-chain identity and ownership verification
without introducing risk or trust assumptions.

3. Deployer Wallet Definition & Responsibility Scope
The deployer wallet is the blockchain address that originally:
- Created the USI Moonik smart contract
- Broadcast the deployment transaction to BNB Smart Chain
- Paid the network gas fees for deployment
- Established the immutable on-chain origin of the token

Control over this deployer wallet constitutes
direct, mathematical proof of responsibility
for the existence of the smart contract.

The deployer wallet does not imply financial authority,
custodianship of user assets,
or the ability to modify balances or supply.
It serves solely as an origin and accountability reference.

4. Signed Message, Deployer Address & Signature Data
The following data constitutes the complete cryptographic proof.
All values are presented in full and unmodified form.

Deployer Wallet Address:
0x22f646f48aa8bf5c7d5dc5bb5f2d8da90641c449

Signed Message (Human-Readable):
"I am the owner and original deployer of the USI Moonik Token (USI),
deployed on BNB Smart Chain under contract address
0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef.
This cryptographic message is signed to publicly verify my ownership,
responsibility, and accountability for this project on usimoonik.com
for blockchain explorer transparency review purposes as of January 2026."

Cryptographic Signature:
0xba60b469d307a0574c036389416348b5a6345e32bac19c26287466c37b5038763249cad6b5cf66e48ac86afa218477cd16ce054756ff1966eaa610ad5acb49911c

The signature above can only be produced
by the holder of the private key
corresponding to the deployer wallet address.

5. Independent, Public & Third-Party Verification
This cryptographic signature has been verified
using BscScan’s official and public signature verification tool.

No custom scripts, private services,
or project-controlled infrastructure are required.

Any third party can independently confirm:
- The exact message content
- The signer wallet address
- The cryptographic validity of the signature
- The absence of manipulation or alteration

6. Compliance Scope & Explicit Limitations
This cryptographic verification serves
only transparency and accountability purposes.

It explicitly does not:
- Grant additional permissions to the deployer
- Modify or upgrade the smart contract
- Enable minting, burning, freezing, or taxation
- Create financial authority over token holders
- Introduce off-chain governance or control

The verification exists solely to demonstrate
that the project owner is real, identifiable,
and cryptographically accountable.

7. Good-Faith Disclosure & Accuracy Statement
This page is published in good faith
to satisfy blockchain explorer review standards,
including BscScan’s requirements for:
- Clear project ownership
- Human accountability
- Non-misleading disclosures

All statements are accurate to the best knowledge
of the project owner and are not intended
to impersonate, misrepresent, or reference
any unrelated public entity or third-party project.
