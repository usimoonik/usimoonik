# Cryptographic Ownership & Deployer Verification

**USI Moonik Token (USI) – BNB Smart Chain – Maximum On-Chain Accountability Proof**

## 1. Purpose, Context & Strong Transparency Motivation

This dedicated page exists exclusively to deliver clear, technical, cryptographically secure, and independently verifiable proof that links the USI Moonik smart contract to its publicly declared human project owner and deployer. The token is a standard BEP-20 on BNB Smart Chain, compliant with all specifications, and exists for educational transparency only.

It directly and comprehensively addresses common blockchain explorer review concerns, especially those raised by BscScan and similar platforms, including:

- Lack of clear, provable project ownership and human accountability – Provided with team profiles.
- Absence of verifiable identity behind the deployer wallet – Cryptographic proof below.
- Reliance on mere text claims without cryptographic backing – On-chain verification used.
- Potential risk of misrepresentation, impersonation, or untraceable control – No distortions.

Rather than depending on screenshots, promises, or off-chain statements, this page relies solely on standard blockchain cryptography — a mathematical, zero-trust method to prove private key control over the deployer wallet. This is the gold standard for on-chain identity verification worldwide.

All content is 100% specific to USI Moonik, original, and not copied/adapted/derived from any external project, public institution, or unrelated entity. The project remains strictly educational — no financial product or investment.

## 2. Explanation of Cryptographic Verification – Simple & Detailed

Blockchain networks like BNB Smart Chain use asymmetric cryptography (public/private key pairs) to prove ownership without revealing secrets.

To prove control:

- The wallet owner signs a human-readable message using their private key (never shared).
- This produces a cryptographic signature (a long hex string).
- Anyone can use public tools to verify: the signature matches the message + wallet address, proving the signer controls the private key.

This method is:

- Zero-trust — no need to believe anyone.
- Publicly verifiable — anyone can check on BscScan or tools like MyEtherWallet/MetaMask.
- Immutable — Signatures are permanent on-chain records.

For USI Moonik, this proves the deployer wallet (which holds the supply) is controlled by the declared founder, ensuring non-anonymous ownership as per BscScan.

## 3. Deployer Wallet Address & Token Context

**Deployer & Owner Wallet Address:**  
0x22f646f48aa8bf5c7d5dc5bb5f2d8da90641c449  

This wallet:  

- Deployed the USI contract on BNB Smart Chain.  
- Holds the initial minted supply (verifiable on BscScan).  
- Has no special powers – Contract is immutable.  

Contract Address: 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef – Verified on 2025-12-04.

## 4. Full Signed Message, Signature & Verification Details

**Signed Message (Exact Text):**  
"I am the owner and original deployer of the USI Moonik Token (USI), deployed on BNB Smart Chain under contract address 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef. This cryptographic message is signed to publicly verify my ownership, responsibility, and accountability for this project on usimoonik.com for blockchain explorer transparency review purposes as of January 2026."  

**Cryptographic Signature (Full Hex):**  
0xba60b469d307a0574c036389416348b5a6345e32bac19c26287466c37b5038763249cad6b5cf66e48ac86afa218477cd16ce054756ff1966eaa610ad5acb49911c  

This signature can only be generated by the private key holder of the deployer address — mathematically impossible otherwise.

## 5. Independent, Public & Third-Party Verification Instructions

The signature has been verified using BscScan's official public tool — no private services needed.  

**Direct BscScan Verification Link:**  
View & Verify Signature on BscScan  

How anyone can verify independently:  

- Go to BscScan Verified Signatures tool (or MyEtherWallet/MetaMask sign/verify section).  
- Enter Address: 0x22f646f48aa8bf5c7d5dc5bb5f2d8da90641c449  
- Paste the exact Signed Message above.  
- Enter the Signature hex.  
- Click Verify → it will confirm "Valid" if the signer controls the key.  

This proves beyond doubt the deployer identity without trust.

## 6. Compliance Scope & Explicit Limitations – No Extra Powers

This cryptographic proof is solely for transparency and accountability — nothing more.  

It does NOT:  

- Grant new permissions to the deployer/owner – No mint/burn.  
- Allow contract upgrades, modifications, or replacements – Immutable.  
- Enable minting, burning, freezing, taxing, or balance control – BEP-20 only.  
- Provide financial authority over users/tokens – Non-financial.  
- Introduce governance, voting, or off-chain control – Educational.  

The contract remains immutable and minimal — verified on BscScan 2025-12-04.

## 7. Good-Faith Disclosure, Accuracy & Independence Statement

This page is published in good faith to meet/exceed BscScan review standards for:  

- Clear, provable ownership – With team profiles.  
- Human accountability via cryptography – On-chain proof.  
- Non-misleading, original disclosures – No distortions.  

All content is accurate, original, and USI Moonik-specific — no impersonation of public entities, no affiliation with Binance/BNB Chain or others.
