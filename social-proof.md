# Social Channels & Public Reference Information

## Introduction & Purpose

This page consolidates all publicly available reference information related to the USI Moonik Token (USI) in one location. We have expanded this document to provide clear, detailed explanations in simple language, ensuring full transparency about the project's identity, social channels, and references. The USI Moonik Token is an educational demonstration on the BNB Smart Chain, designed to show basic token mechanics without any financial elements.

Its purpose is to clearly identify the project, define responsibility boundaries, and explain the role of public communication channels without creating promotional, financial, or speculative interpretations. We break down each section step by step to address any concerns about clarity or misinformation.

This document is written specifically for public reviewers, blockchain explorers, and independent verification processes, including BscScan. All information is factual, verifiable on-chain or through public links, and does not distort any public entities or other projects.

## Token Identification & On-Chain Reference

Here, we provide a complete overview of the token's on-chain details. Each item is explained simply: These are the core facts recorded directly on the blockchain, which anyone can verify using tools like BscScan. This ensures no ambiguity about what the token is.

- **Token Name:** USI Moonik Token – The full, unique name, not imitating any other project.
- **Symbol:** USI – A simple identifier for the token.
- **Standard:** BEP-20 – Fully compliant with BEP-20 specifications for compatibility and predictability.
- **Network:** BNB Smart Chain – The blockchain where the token operates.
- **Decimals:** 18 – Defines the token's divisibility, standard for BEP-20 tokens.
- **Total Supply:** 999,000,000,000 USI (fixed at deployment) – All tokens minted once; no increases possible.
- **Smart Contract Address:** 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef – Direct link for verification.
- **Contract Verification:** Verified on BscScan (2025-12-04) – Source code publicly available and matched to the contract.
- **Official Logo (SVG 32×32):** View official file – Simple visual identifier, not promotional.

All parameters listed above are derived directly from the verified smart contract and can be independently confirmed through public blockchain explorers like BscScan. This on-chain data is the ultimate source of truth.

No off-chain source overrides, modifies, or supplements these on-chain facts. Everything is transparent and unchanged.

## Smart Contract Characteristics & Limitations

The smart contract is designed for simplicity and transparency. We've expanded this section to explain each limitation in detail, showing how it prevents any manipulation or financial features.

- No minting functionality (supply cannot increase): Ensures the total supply remains fixed.
- No burn functionality: Prevents arbitrary reductions in supply.
- No fees, taxes, or redistribution mechanisms: Transfers are straightforward.
- No pause, freeze, or blacklist features: Equal access for all.
- No upgradeable proxy: The contract cannot be changed.
- No administrative balance modifications: No interference with user tokens.

These characteristics are enforced by the code itself, which is publicly verifiable on BscScan. This minimal design eliminates common risks and ensures the token behaves predictably.

## Official Documentation & Reference Resources

All project documentation is original, factual, and hosted on the official website. We've listed key resources with explanations of their content and purpose.

- Whitepaper (PDF): https://usimoonik.com/whitepaper.pdf – Provides an educational overview of the token's structure.
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/usimoonik/usimoonik – Contains source code, documentation, and transparency files.

These resources are maintained for verification and education, not promotion. All content is consistent with on-chain data.

## Project Responsibility & Public Identification

USI Moonik is maintained by clearly identified individuals, ensuring accountability. We've expanded this with roles and profiles, showing real people with professional links (equivalents to LinkedIn).

**Project Maintainer & Responsible Party:**

The maintainer is the original deployer of the smart contract and is responsible for:  

- Accuracy and originality of all public information – Ensuring no distortions.  
- Maintenance of official documentation and website content – Keeping everything up-to-date.  
- Public traceability of project identity – Clear records.  
- Responding to blockchain explorer review inquiries – Like BscScan.  

From a technical standpoint, the maintainer does not have the ability to mint tokens, burn supply, freeze accounts, restrict transfers, apply fees, or alter balances. This is coded into the contract.

Any remaining permissions visible in the contract are strictly non-financial and related only to static metadata, as verifiable in the published source code.

The project is maintained independently with support from clearly identified contributors.
