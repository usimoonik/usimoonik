About USI Moonik
  


  
    USI Moonik Token (USI) is a BEP-20 utility token deployed on the BNB Smart Chain
    with a permanently fixed total supply of 999,000,000,000 USI.
  
  
    The project focuses on transparency, simplicity, and publicly verifiable
    smart contract behavior. All core information is openly documented and
    accessible. The smart contract was fully verified on BscScan as of 2025-12-04.
  
  
    USI Moonik was not created for fundraising, investment, or speculative
    purposes. There was no ICO, IEO, IDO, private sale, or public sale. This token is designed purely for educational purposes, demonstrating blockchain utility, and promoting transparent on-chain interactions without any promises of financial gain or profit. The token's role is to serve as an example of immutable smart contract design, allowing users to learn about token transfers, wallet interactions, and on-chain verifiability in a safe, non-commercial environment.
  
  
    The term “Moonik” refers solely to the project's name and does not imply any financial growth, "moonshot" speculation, or guarantees of value appreciation. It emphasizes transparency, verifiability, and open
    documentation. It does not imply custodial services, fiduciary responsibility,
    or guarantees of any kind. The project's policies include: no minting or burning capabilities, zero transaction fees or taxes, no blacklist or pause mechanisms, and full immutability after deployment to ensure predictable behavior.
