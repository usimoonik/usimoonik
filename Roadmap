Phase 1 (Completed): Smart contract deployment and full on-chain verification
Successfully deployed a completely immutable BEP-20 contract on BNB Smart Chain with fixed total supply of 999,000,000,000 USI. The contract contains no minting, burning, transaction taxes, blacklist functions, pause mechanisms, or any form of administrative/owner controls. Fully verified on BscScan as of 2025-12-04.

Phase 2 (Completed): Publication of official website, documentation, and public transparency resources
Launched the official website (usimoonik.com), published whitepaper (PDF & HTML versions), established GitHub repository, and activated all official social channels to ensure maximum public access and verifiability.

Phase 3 (Ongoing): Continuous maintenance and transparency documentation
Ongoing updates to public documentation, educational resources, and official channels solely for the purpose of maintaining transparency and educational value.

This roadmap contains only completed and ongoing maintenance phases. USI Moonik was created exclusively as an educational demonstration of a fully transparent, immutable, tax-free BEP-20 token with no administrative privileges and no financial mechanisms whatsoever.

There are no speculative milestones, no planned features, no ecosystem expansions, no partnerships, no utility additions, and absolutely no financial or investment-related objectives of any kind.

The project exists solely to illustrate blockchain transparency principles: a simple, fixed-supply, tax-free, renounced, and fully verified smart contract that anyone can independently examine and learn from.

The roadmap is deliberately minimal and neutral. It does not imply, suggest, or promote any future development, value appreciation, trading activity, or profit potential. Holding or transferring USI serves only educational and observational purposes regarding transparent on-chain behavior.

All stated phases are independently verifiable through public blockchain records (BscScan verification date: 2025-12-04), the official website, GitHub repository, and documented social channels.

This roadmap is provided purely for informational and transparency purposes. It creates no commitment, expectation, guarantee, or obligation regarding any future actions or outcomes.

Verification of Completed Phases
Phase 1 and Phase 2 are fully and permanently verifiable via BscScan contract verification, website publication date, public GitHub commits, and active official channels.

Ongoing Transparency Commitment
The only ongoing activity is periodic review and update of public documentation to ensure continued clarity and alignment with blockchain explorer standards for purely educational, non-financial tokens.

Educational Purpose Statement
USI Moonik serves as a neutral, open educational example of best-practice transparent token design: fixed supply, zero taxes, complete immutability, and full public verifiability – without any promotional, speculative, or financial intent.

Public Auditability
Every aspect of the project remains permanently open to independent third-party verification through on-chain data and publicly available resources.

Strict Compliance Statement
This roadmap and the entire project are structured to fully comply with blockchain explorer requirements (including BscScan) for educational, non-speculative, non-financial utility tokens. No element suggests investment, profit, or future value.

No Investment or Speculative Implications
USI Moonik is not an investment vehicle. There are no promises, implications, or suggestions of financial return, utility growth, or token appreciation. The project is strictly educational and transparency-focused.
