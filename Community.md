**USI Moonik Token (USI) – Expanded Transparency Disclosure & Educational Project Information**

## 1. Clear Project & Token Identification – Full Details

USI Moonik Token (symbol: USI) is a standard BEP-20 token deployed on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). The smart contract is immutable, fully verified on BscScan since December 04, 2025, and can be independently inspected by anyone at any time.

**Contract Address:** 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef

**Key immutable parameters:**

- **Total Supply:** Exactly 999,000,000,000 USI (999 billion) – permanently fixed, no minting possible
- **Decimals:** 18
- **No transaction taxes, fees, reflections, blacklists, pause functions, or upgradeable logic**

The project is **fully independent** — no connection, affiliation, partnership, or endorsement exists with Binance, BNB Chain team, any exchange, launchpad, or third-party organization. All content is original and truthful.

**Repeated for emphasis:** This is strictly an **educational blockchain demonstration** — not a financial product, investment opportunity, or commercial platform.

## 2. Explicit Project Purpose – Strictly Non-Financial & Educational

The **sole purpose** of USI Moonik is education, transparency, and serving as a public reference for blockchain learners and explorers:

- Demonstrating real-world operation of a minimal, immutable BEP-20 token
- Enabling public verification of contract behavior and supply immutability
- Providing a clean, simple example for understanding blockchain transparency
- Supporting blockchain explorer (e.g., BscScan) compliance and review processes

There are **no** financial objectives:

- No investment solicitation, profit promises, or returns implied
- No ICO/IDO/sale, staking, yield, rewards, or fundraising
- No governance, DAO, or user voting mechanisms

The token exists purely on-chain — users interact directly via their wallets with no project custody or dependency.

To meet BscScan and explorer transparency standards, the founder and team are **fully disclosed** with **multiple verifiable public professional profiles** (standard in Web3 as equivalents to LinkedIn: X for visibility, GitHub for contributions, etc.).
