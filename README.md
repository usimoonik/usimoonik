# USI Moonik Token (USI)

USI Moonik Token (USI) is a fixed-supply BEP-20 utility token deployed on BNB Smart Chain (BSC). The project is designed strictly for transparency, educational use, community engagement, and verifiable on-chain interaction. This repository is provided for public documentation, source code verification, and blockchain explorer review purposes. All information is fully consistent with the official website, whitepaper, and on-chain data.

To address transparency concerns and ensure clarity, the following detailed overview is provided. This project emphasizes complete openness, with all details verifiable through independent sources such as BSCScan, the official GitHub repository, and the project's website. No aspect of the token or project is hidden or ambiguous, and users are encouraged to cross-reference all provided information with on-chain data for validation.

## Token Information

- **Token Name:** USI Moonik Token  
- **Symbol:** USI  
- **Standard:** BEP-20  
- **Network:** BNB Smart Chain  
- **Decimals:** 18  
- **Total Supply:** 999,000,000,000 USI (999.00B, Fixed and Immutable)  
- **Contract Address:** 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef  
- **BSCScan (Verified Contract):** https://bscscan.com/address/0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef (Source code verified on December 04, 2025; Fully auditable and open for independent review)

This section provides a comprehensive breakdown of the token's core attributes. The token adheres to the BEP-20 standard, ensuring compatibility with wallets, exchanges, and dApps on the BNB Smart Chain. The total supply is permanently capped, with no mechanisms for inflation or deflation, promoting predictability and trust. For further clarity, users can directly query the contract on BSCScan to confirm these parameters in real-time.

## Smart Contract Properties

- Fixed supply created at deployment with no possibility of increase  
- No mint function – Permanently disabled  
- No burn function – No mechanisms to reduce supply  
- No transaction fees or taxes (0% on buys, sells, or transfers)  
- No blacklist, pause, or restriction mechanisms  
- No ownership override or admin control – Ownership effectively renounced at deployment  

The smart contract is fully verified and immutable on BSCScan. Users are encouraged to review the source code independently at: https://bscscan.com/address/0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef#code  

This design ensures maximum predictability, decentralization, and compliance with transparency standards for utility tokens. To elaborate, the absence of mint and burn functions means the token supply is locked forever, preventing any form of manipulation. The lack of fees or taxes simplifies transactions, making it ideal for educational demonstrations. Ownership renouncement was executed immediately post-deployment to eliminate any centralized control, as verifiable on-chain. This structure aligns with best practices for transparent blockchain projects, reducing risks associated with modifiable contracts.

## Token Purpose & Nature

USI Moonik Token is not an investment product. The token was created exclusively for:  
- Educational blockchain demonstrations  
- Technical testing and learning environments  
- Transparent on-chain interaction examples  
- Community-driven initiatives and social engagements  

The project does not involve:  
- ICO, IEO, IDO  
- Private or public token sales  
- Fundraising or investment activity  
- Profit expectation or financial promotion  
- Any promises of value appreciation, liquidity, or financial returns  

All use cases are non-commercial and focused on blockchain education and transparency. To provide further clarity on the project's nature, USI Moonik serves as a reference implementation for studying BEP-20 tokens. For instance, developers can use it to test token transfers, wallet integrations, or smart contract interactions without financial implications. Community engagements include open discussions on blockchain transparency, with no monetary incentives. This educational focus is documented extensively in the whitepaper and official resources, ensuring users understand the non-speculative intent.

## Token Supply & Holder Disclosure

At the time of publication, 100% of the total token supply is held by the original deployment wallet used to deploy the smart contract. No tokens have been sold, distributed, or transferred as part of any fundraising, promotional activity, team allocation, or community distribution. All token balances, holders, and movements are publicly verifiable on the blockchain via BSCScan: https://bscscan.com/token/0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef  

This disclosure is provided for full transparency and compliance with explorer review processes. The deployment wallet serves solely as an on-chain holding address with no special privileges. For added transparency, the wallet's transaction history is empty of any sales or distributions, as confirmed by BSCScan records. Future distributions, if any, would be announced publicly and solely for educational purposes, such as airdrops to verified learners, but none are planned or promised.

## Project Ownership & Responsibility

**Project Owner Name:** usi moonik  

The project owner, usi moonik, is the founder and primary maintainer, responsible for the overall vision, transparency oversight, and ensuring all project elements align with educational and non-financial goals. As the original deployer of the smart contract, usi moonik holds accountability for deployment verification, website management, and official communications. Ownership is maintained solely for administrative transparency, with no control over token balances or user interactions, as the contract's ownership functions are renounced. This structure ensures that the project remains decentralized and free from centralized manipulation, while providing a clear point of contact for accountability. All actions by the owner are documented publicly through GitHub commits, BSCScan records, and official channels, allowing independent verification.
