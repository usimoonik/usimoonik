  <h3>1. Executive Summary</h3>
  <p>This document is provided primarily for transparency, educational purposes, and blockchain explorer verification processes.</p>
  <p>USI Moonik Token (USI) is a community-driven blockchain-based digital token developed under the BEP-20 standard on the BNB Smart Chain.</p>
  <p>The project is designed with a strong focus on transparency, verifiable smart contract behavior, simplicity, and community engagement. USI Moonik does not represent an investment product and is not intended to generate financial returns or profits.</p>
  <p>The smart contract was deployed with a fixed total supply. No minting, burning, taxation, or administrative control mechanisms exist within the contract, ensuring immutability and predictability.</p>
</section>

<hr>

<section>
  <h3>2. Project Overview</h3>
  <p>USI Moonik was created to provide a simple, transparent, and community-oriented utility token for educational, experimental, and decentralized use cases.</p>
  <p>The project emphasizes open documentation, public verification, consistency across all official resources (including the website, source code repository, and blockchain explorer data), and active community involvement through social channels.</p>
  <p>There was no token sale, presale, fundraising event, or distribution offering associated with the project. All supply was minted at deployment for full transparency.</p>
</section>

<hr>

<section>
  <h3>3. Token Specifications</h3>
  <p>The USI Moonik Token adheres to the BEP-20 standard, ensuring full compatibility with BNB Smart Chain wallets, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and applications.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed Supply: The total supply is permanently capped at deployment with no possibility of increase.</li>
    <li>Immutable Contract: No functions exist to alter supply, implement taxes, or add controls post-deployment.</li>
    <li>Verifiable Source: The contract source code is publicly available, verified on blockchain explorers like BSCScan, and open for independent audits.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<hr>

<section>
  <h3>4. Smart Contract Security</h3>
  <p>The contract implements only standard BEP-20 functions without additional features that could introduce vulnerabilities or complexities.</p>
  <p>No third-party audits were conducted as the contract uses verified, standard implementations. However, the code is open-source for community review.</p>
  <p>Users are strongly encouraged to independently verify the contract code on BSCScan before any interaction to ensure understanding of its behavior.</p>
</section>

<hr>

<section>
  <h3>5. Use Cases</h3>
  <p>USI Moonik is intended for:</p>

    <li>Experimental testing in decentralized environments and community projects</li>
    <li>Community-driven transparency initiatives and social engagements</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is not designed for commercial, financial, speculative, or investment applications. Any use beyond basic transfers is at the user's discretion.</p>

  <h3>6. Governance & Maintenance</h3>

  <h3>19. Token Holding & Deployment Wallet Disclosure</h3>
  <p>At the time of smart contract deployment, one hundred percent (100%) of the total USI Moonik Token supply was assigned to the deploying wallet.</p>

  <p>No token distribution, sale, transfer event, or allocation program was conducted at or after deployment.</p>
  <p>The presence of tokens in the deployer wallet does not represent:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An investment reserve</li>
    <li>A treasury</li>
    <li>A fundraising pool</li>
    <li>A promise of future distribution</li>
    <li>A financial control mechanism</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The deployer wallet functions as a transparent on-chain holding address, fully visible and verifiable through BNB Smart Chain explorers like BSCScan.</p>
  <p>All token balances and movements (if any) remain publicly auditable and subject to independent verification.</p>
</section>

    <li>Mint additional tokens</li>
    <li>Restrict transfers</li>
    <li>Alter balances programmatically</li>
