USI Moonik Token (USI) • Maximum Public Identity Disclosure & Explorer Compliance Page

1. Project Identity & Clear Public Definition – Detailed Overview
USI Moonik is a completely independent, non-corporate blockchain educational project deployed exclusively on the BNB Smart Chain using the standard BEP-20 token protocol.

The project consists of a single, immutable smart contract (verified on BscScan since December 04, 2025), accompanied by open, truthful documentation, fully disclosed ownership, and publicly identifiable contributors. Its only goal is to serve as a real-world, on-chain reference for how a minimal, transparent, and predictable BEP-20 token can exist without complexity, hidden features, or financial mechanics.

USI Moonik is explicitly NOT a company, foundation, DAO, investment platform, financial service, startup, or profit-oriented entity. It does not operate under any registered corporate structure, does not represent shares, securities, equity, or any form of ownership rights, and does not generate or promise profits, yields, or returns.

2. Ownership, Control & Full Accountability – Public Founder Disclosure
Founder & Sole Project Owner:
usi moonik

The founder is publicly and unambiguously identified from the project's inception and bears full, exclusive, and personal responsibility for every aspect: smart contract creation/deployment, BscScan verification, website/domain management, official documentation, public communications, and strict adherence to transparency and educational-only principles.

All critical actions — including contract deployment, source code publication, content updates, and responses to transparency inquiries — are executed directly under the authority and accountability of the identified founder. There is no delegated control to anonymous parties, third-party services, proxy operators, or external entities.

3. Project Governance & Decision-Making Structure – Founder-Led
USI Moonik is founder-owned and founder-operated with a simple, transparent structure: all decisions, updates, and responsibilities are managed directly by the founder, supported by the publicly disclosed core team members (detailed below).

There is no DAO, governance token, voting mechanism, community control, or decentralized decision-making. The project is not run by a committee, board, foundation, or anonymous group.

This centralized accountability ensures maximum clarity for BscScan and explorers: every action traces back to identifiable individuals.

4. Core Team Members & Public Professional Profiles – Full Disclosure
To meet BscScan and explorer standards for non-anonymous teams, core contributors are fully disclosed with multiple verifiable public professional profiles (X for public engagement, GitHub for code contributions, Telegram for communication, Bitcointalk for forum presence, Medium for articles — equivalents to LinkedIn in the blockchain/Web3 space).

Team members assist the founder in specific, non-financial roles: documentation review, transparency maintenance, and educational consistency. They have no control over the smart contract, token supply, or on-chain operations.
