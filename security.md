# Security, Ownership & Transparency Statement

## Introduction & Purpose

This document serves as an official, detailed, and permanent clarification regarding the authenticity, ownership, technical integrity, transparency, and strictly non-commercial nature of the USI Moonik Token (USI) project. We have expanded this page with clear explanations, verifiable proofs, and comprehensive details to address BscScan's requirements for transparent information about the token, project, founder, and team.

This page is published specifically to meet blockchain explorer review requirements, including but not limited to BscScan project verification, smart contract transparency, and signature validation (Verifysig). It provides factual evidence of ownership, security features, and social channels, all verifiable on-chain or through public profiles.

All information herein is factual, independently verifiable on-chain, non-promotional, and provided solely to eliminate ambiguity, misinterpretation, or misleading assumptions. The project is educational only, with no financial elements, and no distortions from public entities or other projects.

## 1. Official Website Authenticity & Domain Control

The domain https://usimoonik.com is the one and only official website associated with the USI Moonik project. This domain is registered, owned, and directly controlled by the project founder under the USI Moonik name, with no third-party involvement.

To ensure authenticity, the website uses secure HTTPS protocol, and all content is static without dynamic elements that could be exploited. No third-party hosting services with shared control, proxy ownership, white-label platforms, or delegated domain management are used. Domain registration details can be verified through public WHOIS lookups.

There are no mirror websites, no alternative domains, no subdomains, and no translated clones authorized to represent this project. Any such sites should be considered unauthorized and potentially fraudulent.

Any website, page, domain, or service claiming association with USI Moonik outside of this official domain should be considered unauthorized, unaffiliated, and reported. This policy protects users and ensures transparency.

## 2. Website Security & Technical Integrity

The official website is intentionally designed as a static informational site to maximize security and minimize risks. It contains no interactive features that could be vulnerable to attacks. Specifically:

- No user accounts or authentication systems – Prevents data breaches.
- No login forms or data collection forms – No personal information stored.
- No cookies or tracking mechanisms – Respects user privacy.
- No analytics services or third-party scripts – No external data leaks.
- No databases, APIs, or server-side code – Reduces attack surface.

The site is hosted on a secure, reputable platform with regular security audits, HTTPS enforcement, and DDoS protection. All content is served directly without redirects or external embeds that could introduce vulnerabilities.

## 3. Social Media Channels & Public Profiles

All official social channels are created and managed directly by the identified team members. These channels are used exclusively for transparency announcements, educational clarifications, and identity verification – never for promotion, speculation, or financial content.

To prevent impersonation, we list all channels with their purposes:

- X (Twitter): https://x.com/usimoonik – For transparency notices and identity signals.
- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/usimoonik/ – Archival educational posts.
- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/usimoonik/ – Visual references for clarity.
- Medium: https://medium.com/@usimoonik – Long-form educational articles.
- GitHub: https://github.com/usimoonik/usimoonik – Source code and documentation repo.
- Bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5570878 – Public thread for verifications.
- Telegram: t.me/usimoonik – General transparency inquiries.

Each channel is verified through cross-links and consistent messaging. No anonymous admins exist; all are tied to named team members. Any unlisted accounts are not official.

## 4. Official Logo & Visual Authenticity

The project's official logo is a simple, original design created specifically for USI Moonik. It is provided in SVG format (32×32) for high-quality, scalable use: View official logo file.

The logo does not imitate any existing brands, projects, or public entities. It is used consistently across all official channels for easy identification. Any alterations or unauthorized use should be considered fraudulent.

## 5. Smart Contract Security & Verification

The USI Moonik smart contract was deployed with a focus on minimalism and security. It is a standard BEP-20 implementation with no custom financial logic, reducing potential vulnerabilities.

Key security features:

- Immutability: No upgrade proxy or modifiable code – Once deployed, unchanged.
- No mint/burn: Fixed supply prevents inflation or destruction.
- No fees/taxes: Transfers are straightforward without deductions.
- No admin controls: Owner cannot freeze, blacklist, or seize tokens.
- Source Code Verified: On BscScan (2025-12-04) – Matches deployed bytecode.

The contract has been internally reviewed for common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow, access control). No external audit was necessary due to its simplicity, but the code is open for community audits.

## 6. Founder, Ownership & Team Accountability

BscScan requires clear identification of responsible parties. The project is founder-led with a small, identifiable team. We've provided detailed roles and professional profiles (equivalents to LinkedIn) for verification.

**Founder & Contract Owner**  
**Name:** usi moonik  
**Role:** Original deployer and current owner – Responsible for deployment, verifications, and transparency.  

Ownership is maintained for administrative clarifications only (e.g., this document). It grants no control over tokens or balances.

**Core Team Members**  
**amob animo**  
Role: Technical documentation support and contract review.  
Responsibilities: Ensuring code clarity, BEP-20 compliance, and assisting with verifications.  
Profiles: X | GitHub | Telegram | Bitcointalk | Medium  

**houno minp**  
Role: Documentation clarity and public information coordination.  
Responsibilities: Maintaining consistent materials and supporting BscScan clarifications.  
Profiles: X | GitHub | Telegram | Medium  

Team members are responsible solely for documentation, transparency, and public disclosure. No financial management, token distributions, or custodial services are offered. All members are accountable and verifiable.

## 7. Legal Position & Risk Clarification

USI Moonik is a transparency-oriented blockchain reference project with no legal entity status or financial operations.

It does not provide financial advice, investment opportunities, guarantees, or services. Any interaction with the token is entirely voluntary and at the user's sole discretion and responsibility.

The project disclaims all liability related to speculative use, third-party listings, external market activity, or any risks beyond the team's control, such as blockchain network issues.

## 8. BscScan Review & Signature Verification – On-Chain Proof of Ownership

To provide undeniable proof of ownership as required by BscScan, the project has completed on-chain verification steps, including smart contract source code verification and a signed message validation (Verifysig).

The verified signature (#15078 on BscScan) confirms the founder's ownership:

- Signer Address: 0x22f64f648aa8bf5c7d5dc5bb5f12bd8da90641c449 – This is the MetaMask wallet used to deploy the contract.
- Message: "I am the owner and deployer of USI Moonik Token (USI) with contract address 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef. This signature verifies my ownership for transparency on usimoonik.com as January 2026."
- Signature Hash: 0xba60b469d307a0574ac0363899416348b5a6345e32bac19c262c7466c375b03763249cad6b5cfc56e648ac86afa21847cd1c6ce05475f61996eea010ad5acb49911c

View the full verification on BscScan: https://bscscan.com/verifiedSignatures#15078. This on-chain proof demonstrates that the signer controls the deployer wallet, which currently holds 100% of the token supply (999,000,000,000 USI), with no distributions made.

This page exists explicitly to support manual review processes by blockchain explorers and to provide extended clarity where short summaries are insufficient. All claims can be independently verified via the contract page on BscScan.

This statement is final, factual, and published in good faith to ensure maximum clarity, transparency, and public understanding.
