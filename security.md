Security, Ownership & Transparency Statement
1. Introduction & Purpose
This document serves as an official, detailed, and permanent clarification regarding the authenticity, ownership, technical integrity, transparency, and strictly non-commercial nature of the USI Moonik Token (USI) project. We have expanded this page with clear explanations, verifiable proofs, and comprehensive details to address BscScan's requirements for transparent information about the token, project, founder, and team.

This page is published specifically to meet blockchain explorer review requirements, including but not limited to BscScan project verification, smart contract transparency, and signature validation (Verifysig). It provides factual evidence of ownership, security features, and social channels, all verifiable on-chain or through public profiles.

All information herein is factual, independently verifiable on-chain, non-promotional, and provided solely to eliminate ambiguity, misinterpretation, or misleading assumptions. The project is educational only, with no financial elements, and no distortions from public entities or other projects.

2. Official Website Authenticity & Domain Control
The domain https://usimoonik.com is the one and only official website associated with the USI Moonik project. This domain is registered, owned, and directly controlled by the project founder under the USI Moonik name, with no third-party involvement.

To ensure authenticity, the website uses secure HTTPS protocol, and all content is static without dynamic elements that could be exploited. No third-party hosting services with shared control, proxy ownership, white-label platforms, or delegated domain management are used. Domain registration details can be verified through public WHOIS lookups.

There are no mirror websites, no alternative domains, no subdomains, and no translated clones authorized to represent this project. Any such sites should be considered unauthorized and potentially fraudulent.

Any website, page, domain, or service claiming association with USI Moonik outside of this official domain should be considered unauthorized, unaffiliated, and reported. This policy protects users and ensures transparency.

3. Website Security & Technical Integrity
The official website is intentionally designed as a static informational site to maximize security and minimize risks. It contains no interactive features that could be vulnerable to attacks. Specifically:

No user accounts or authentication systems – Prevents data breaches.
No login forms or data collection forms – No personal information stored.
No cookies or tracking mechanisms – Respects user privacy.
No analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Meta Pixel) – No third-party tracking.
No JavaScript frameworks or external scripts – Reduces vulnerability surface.
No API connections or blockchain interaction tools – Purely informational.
The website does not host or link to token sales, swaps, claim pages, dashboards, staking tools, investment portals, or any financial interfaces. Its sole function is to provide public disclosure, educational materials, and long-form documentation for verification purposes.

Security is further ensured through regular updates to the hosting environment and monitoring for unauthorized changes. The site is hosted on a secure platform with SSL encryption, and all files are version-controlled in the public GitHub repository for transparency.

4. Official Communication Channels & Social Networks
To provide complete and verifiable transparency as required by BscScan, all legitimate project communications are limited strictly to the following verified channels. These are used exclusively for educational updates, transparency clarifications, and verification responses – never for financial promotion, price discussions, or speculation.

5. Token Supply & On-Chain Transparency
The total fixed supply of the USI token is 999,000,000,000 USI. This supply was created in a single mint transaction at deployment and is permanently capped, as enforced by the immutable smart contract.

The smart contract is deployed on BNB Smart Chain and fully verified on BscScan as of 2025-12-04. The contract address is 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef.

The contract contains:

No minting functionality – Supply cannot increase.
No burning mechanism – Supply cannot decrease.
No tax, fee, or reflection logic – Transfers are simple.
No ownership privileges or admin controls over balances – No manipulation possible.
No upgradeability or proxy logic – Code is permanent.
Currently, the full supply remains in the original deployment wallet (the MetaMask wallet used to deploy the contract) for complete transparency and traceability. This wallet holds 100% of the tokens, with no distributions, sales, or transfers to liquidity pools or third parties. All holdings and transactions are publicly visible on BscScan for independent verification.

6. No Sale, No Distribution, No Financial Activity
USI Moonik has not conducted and will not conduct any form of token distribution or financial activity. Specifically:

No presales or public sales – No tokens sold.
No private funding rounds – No investments sought.
No airdrops or reward campaigns – No giveaways implying value.
No liquidity offerings or farming programs – No DeFi integrations.
No marketing token distributions – No promotions.
The token does not represent or function as:

An investment product – No returns expected.
A security or share – No ownership rights.
A promise of profit or yield – No earnings.
A governance right – No voting.
A utility claim or service access – Educational only.
This strict non-financial policy ensures compliance and prevents any speculation.

7. Team Structure & Responsibility
The USI Moonik project is maintained by a small, publicly identifiable team of real individuals. Their roles are limited to non-financial activities like documentation and transparency maintenance. BscScan requires clear team disclosure with professional profiles, which are provided below for verification.

8. Legal Position & Risk Clarification
USI Moonik is a transparency-oriented blockchain reference project with no legal entity status or financial operations.

It does not provide financial advice, investment opportunities, guarantees, or services. Any interaction with the token is entirely voluntary and at the user's sole discretion and responsibility.

The project disclaims all liability related to speculative use, third-party listings, external market activity, or any risks beyond the team's control, such as blockchain network issues.

9. BscScan Review & Signature Verification – On-Chain Proof of Ownership
To provide undeniable proof of ownership as required by BscScan, the project has completed on-chain verification steps, including smart contract source code verification and a signed message validation (Verifysig).

The verified signature (#15078 on BscScan) confirms the founder's ownership:

Signer Address: 0x22f64f648aa8bf5c7d5dc5bb5f12bd8da90641c449 – This is the MetaMask wallet used to deploy the contract.
Message: "I am the owner and deployer of USI Moonik Token (USI) with contract address 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef. This signature verifies my ownership for transparency on usimoonik.com as January 2026."
Signature Hash: 0xba60b469d307a0574ac0363899416348b5a6345e32bac19c262c7466c375b03763249cad6b5cfc56e648ac86afa21847cd1c6ce05475f61996eea010ad5acb49911c
View the full verification on BscScan: https://bscscan.com/verifiedSignatures#15078. This on-chain proof demonstrates that the signer controls the deployer wallet, which currently holds 100% of the token supply (999,000,000,000 USI), with no distributions made.

This page exists explicitly to support manual review processes by blockchain explorers and to provide extended clarity where short summaries are insufficient. All claims can be independently verified via the contract page on BscScan.
