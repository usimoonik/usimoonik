Audit & Security Report
USI Moonik Token (USI) • BscScan-Verified & Transparent

Introduction & Purpose
This page provides a detailed audit and security report for the USI Moonik Token (USI) smart contract. As an educational, non-financial BEP-20 token on the BNB Smart Chain, the contract is minimal and immutable, reducing the need for extensive external audits. However, to meet transparency standards like those of BscScan, we have conducted an internal review and made the code fully open for community verification.

The USI Moonik Token fully complies with BEP-20 specifications, including standard functions for transfers, balances, and approvals, with no custom financial logic. This report confirms the contract's security, lack of vulnerabilities, and non-financial nature, with all findings verifiable on-chain.

1. Audit Scope & Methodology
The audit covers the entire smart contract code, focusing on:

BEP-20 compliance – Verified standard functions without deviations.
Security vulnerabilities – Checked for common issues like reentrancy, overflow, access control.
Immutability – Confirmed no upgrade/proxy mechanisms.
Non-financial features – Ensured no mint, burn, tax, or reward logic.
Methodology: Internal manual review by the team, automated tools (e.g., Slither, Mythril via local setup), and public BscScan verification. No third-party audit firm was used due to the contract's simplicity (minimal code lines), but the source is open for external reviews.

Audit Date: January 2026.
Contract Verified on BscScan: December 04, 2025.
Contract Address: 0x349dC946aC011F2d22a10801AeAf1ef46B1ef6Ef

2. Key Findings & Security Assessment
No critical vulnerabilities were found. The contract is secure due to its minimal design:

No Mint/Burn: Supply fixed forever – No inflation risks.
No Fees/Taxes: Transfers are straightforward – No hidden deductions.
No Admin Controls: Owner cannot alter balances or pause – Reduces centralization risks.
Immutable Code: No upgrades – Prevents post-deployment changes.
Access Control: Standard Ownable from OpenZeppelin, but limited to non-sensitive functions.
Reentrancy Protection: Not applicable due to no external calls.
Overflow/Underflow: SafeMath used where needed.
Overall Risk Level: Low. The contract's simplicity eliminates common attack vectors. Full code is verified on BscScan for public audits.

3. Recommendations & Community Review
- Users should always verify the contract address before interacting.
- For advanced reviews, clone the GitHub repo and run local tests.
- Community contributions to audits are welcome via GitHub issues.

If needed, we can engage external auditors like Certik in the future, but the current design doesn't warrant it.

4. Non-Financial Declaration
This audit confirms the token's non-financial nature. No mechanisms for yield, staking, or profits exist. The project is educational only.

Reminder: USI Moonik Token (USI) is strictly an educational demonstration on the BNB Smart Chain — not an investment, not a financial product, and contains no profit mechanisms of any kind.
